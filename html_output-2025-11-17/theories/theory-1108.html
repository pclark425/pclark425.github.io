                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1108</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Structured Abstraction for Logical Reasoning in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) achieve strict logical reasoning by internally constructing and manipulating structured abstractions—such as symbolic graphs, logic programs, or formal representations—derived from natural language input. The ability to abstract, maintain, and operate on these structures enables LMs to perform multi-step, compositional, and context-sensitive logical inference beyond surface-level pattern matching.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LMs with explicit mechanisms for constructing structured abstractions (e.g., logic graphs, symbolic scratchpads) will outperform those without on strict logical reasoning tasks.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LMs are trained to induce structured abstractions end-to-end, they may develop novel, non-human-like representations that still support strict logic.</li>
                <li>Structured abstraction mechanisms may enable LMs to generalize logical reasoning to novel domains or logics not seen during training.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LMs without any structured abstraction mechanism can match or exceed the logical consistency of those with such mechanisms, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing abstraction fidelity does not improve logical consistency, the theory's sufficiency claim is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some very large LMs show improved logical consistency without explicit structured abstraction, possibly due to scale or emergent properties. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
