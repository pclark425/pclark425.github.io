                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Validated LLM-Driven Curriculum Effectiveness Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about optimal curricula for compositional acquisition of commonsense and science procedures in interactive text environments, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large language models can generate highly effective automatic curricula that substantially outperform hand-designed and simple heuristic curricula (1.8-82× improvements) when properly implemented with essential validation mechanisms, but fail catastrophically without them (12-31% success rates). Effectiveness critically depends on: (1) offline reusable code/function generation rather than frequent online queries (10-100× more efficient), (2) mandatory validation mechanisms (schema validation, execution verification, or VLM feedback - removing these causes 52-93% relative performance reductions), (3) retrieval augmentation from prior successful curricula (RAG/VDB), (4) environment-grounded generation (exploration-first with feedback produces 70-85% valid data vs <30% for proposal-first), (5) explicit diversity-promoting mechanisms (batch generation, temperature cycling, persona prompts), and (6) iterative refinement loops. LLM curricula excel in verifiable domains with compositional structure (mathematics, code generation, robotics with proper validation) and can handle long-horizon tasks when combined with hierarchical decomposition and staged curricula. Curriculum generation quality depends significantly on LLM capability (GPT-4 class models substantially outperform smaller models). Note that adaptive non-LLM curricula using on-policy signals (e.g., SEC using advantage-based selection) can also be highly effective, suggesting that the key factors are adaptive selection, proper validation, and domain-appropriate feedback rather than LLM use per se. Without proper implementation methodology, LLM curricula show 12-31% success rates and <30% valid training data, making implementation approach more critical than the use of LLMs alone.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Properly implemented LLM-generated curricula provide 1.8-82× improvements over baseline approaches in verifiable domains with compositional structure, but only when combined with essential validation mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Offline reusable code/function generation (updated periodically) is 10-100× more computationally efficient and equally or more effective than frequent online LLM query approaches.</li>
                <li>Validation mechanisms (schema validation, execution verification, or VLM feedback) are essential requirements, not optional enhancements: removing them causes 52-93% relative performance reductions (e.g., AURA 99%→38% without VDB, 99%→47% without schema, 99%→7% without multi-agent decomposition).</li>
                <li>Environment-grounded curriculum generation (exploration-first with iterative feedback) produces 2-3× higher valid training data rates (70-85% vs <30%) than proposal-first approaches.</li>
                <li>Retrieval augmentation (RAG/VDB) from prior successful curricula is a critical complementary system that substantially improves first-launch correctness and curriculum quality (e.g., AURA 99%→38% without VDB).</li>
                <li>LLM curricula can effectively handle long-horizon tasks when combined with hierarchical decomposition, staged curricula, and proper scaffolding; without these, long-horizon performance degrades significantly.</li>
                <li>Curriculum generation quality depends significantly on LLM capability: GPT-4 class models substantially outperform smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o T=0.290 vs GLM4-9B T=0.134 in SDW).</li>
                <li>Diversity-promoting mechanisms (batch generation, temperature cycling, persona prompts, explicit novelty objectives) are essential for curriculum quality and prevent repetitive or low-quality curricula.</li>
                <li>LLM curricula excel in verifiable domains with compositional structure (mathematics, code generation, robotics with proper validation) where verification mechanisms can provide reliable feedback.</li>
                <li>Iterative refinement and feedback loops are essential for reliability: successful implementations use closed-loop adaptation rather than one-shot generation.</li>
                <li>Unvalidated LLM curriculum generation fails catastrophically: 12-31% success rates (CurricuLLM 31%, Eureka 12%) and massive computational waste (5-16 launches per stage vs 1 for validated approaches).</li>
                <li>Off-policy integration of LLM curricula (e.g., supervised fine-tuning on LLM-selected expert traces) can cause catastrophic performance collapse (near 0% accuracy initially) due to distribution shift.</li>
                <li>Computational cost has multiple dimensions: generation-time cost (curriculum synthesis), training-time cost (RL steps), and inference-time cost (online queries); proper design achieves efficiency through offline generation and caching.</li>
                <li>Adaptive curriculum selection with proper feedback mechanisms is the key factor for effectiveness: both LLM-based approaches (with validation) and non-LLM approaches (e.g., SEC using advantage signals) can achieve substantial improvements when they incorporate adaptive selection and domain-appropriate feedback.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>AURA achieves 99% training-launch success with schema validation and retrieval augmentation, compared to 31% for CurricuLLM and 12% for Eureka on complex robotics tasks, demonstrating that properly validated LLM-generated curricula vastly outperform sampling-based approaches and reduce computational waste (single launch vs 5-16 launches per stage). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2047.html#e2047.0" class="evidence-link">[e2047.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2047.html#e2047.1" class="evidence-link">[e2047.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2047.html#e2047.2" class="evidence-link">[e2047.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2047.html#e2047.3" class="evidence-link">[e2047.3]</a> </li>
    <li>LADDER demonstrates 1%→82% improvement (82× gain) on undergraduate integration problems using LLM-generated recursive variant trees, with strong generalization from only 10 training problems to 100 test problems, and TTRL further improves MIT Integration Bee performance from 73%→90%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2048.html#e2048.0" class="evidence-link">[e2048.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2048.html#e2048.1" class="evidence-link">[e2048.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2048.html#e2048.2" class="evidence-link">[e2048.2]</a> </li>
    <li>TTC-RL achieves ~1.8-2.1× improvements on competition-level math (AIME25: 40%→62% pass@8) and coding (CodeElo: 28%→43% pass@8) using LLM-embedding-based curriculum selection (SIFT), substantially outperforming uniform sampling and domain-only heuristics. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2054.html#e2054.0" class="evidence-link">[e2054.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2054.html#e2054.1" class="evidence-link">[e2054.1]</a> </li>
    <li>SGRL outperforms frequent-query LLM baselines (score 33.8±1.5 vs AdaRefiner 28.5±2.3, ELLM 28.4±2.5) while requiring minimal LLM invocations through reusable goal-generation code, and unlocks deep achievements (Collect Diamond at ~3.7M steps) that baselines fail to reach by 5M steps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.0" class="evidence-link">[e2049.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.1" class="evidence-link">[e2049.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.2" class="evidence-link">[e2049.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.3" class="evidence-link">[e2049.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.4" class="evidence-link">[e2049.4]</a> </li>
    <li>EXIF's exploration-first + iterative feedback approach yields large improvements (Webshop reward +29.4 to +51.7 for different models, Crafter AP +18.8 to +20.5) and produces 70-85% valid training data vs <30% for proposal-first LLM curricula. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2045.html#e2045.0" class="evidence-link">[e2045.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2045.html#e2045.1" class="evidence-link">[e2045.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2045.html#e2045.2" class="evidence-link">[e2045.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2045.html#e2045.3" class="evidence-link">[e2045.3]</a> </li>
    <li>WebSynthesis achieves 20.15% Pass@3 with ~4k LLM-assisted synthetic samples, outperforming OS-Genesis (18.66%) trained on 7.4k real trajectories and AgentTrek (11.94%) with 20k tutorial samples. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2052.html#e2052.0" class="evidence-link">[e2052.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2052.html#e2052.1" class="evidence-link">[e2052.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2052.html#e2052.2" class="evidence-link">[e2052.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2052.html#e2052.3" class="evidence-link">[e2052.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2052.html#e2052.4" class="evidence-link">[e2052.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Retrieval augmentation (RAG/VDB) is critical: removing VDB in AURA reduced success from 99%→38% (62% relative reduction), DSMentor's retrieval-augmented memory substantially improved performance, and HierQ-LLM's RAG-based context extraction achieved 100% accuracy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2047.html#e2047.3" class="evidence-link">[e2047.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2046.html#e2046.0" class="evidence-link">[e2046.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2051.html#e2051.0" class="evidence-link">[e2051.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Self-aware RL achieves +53.8% relative gain on math benchmarks (21.0→32.3 average) using LLM-generated tasks with difficulty prediction while querying external guidance on only 1.23% of tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2042.html#e2042.0" class="evidence-link">[e2042.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2042.html#e2042.1" class="evidence-link">[e2042.1]</a> </li>
    <li>CRAFT achieves high success rates (90% Gate, 60% Seesaw, 100% Two Arm Lift) with LLM-generated curricula and VLM-guided refinement, and demonstrates zero-shot sim-to-real transfer (65% hardware success). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2043.html#e2043.0" class="evidence-link">[e2043.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2043.html#e2043.1" class="evidence-link">[e2043.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2043.html#e2043.2" class="evidence-link">[e2043.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Removing validation mechanisms causes severe performance degradation: AURA without schema validation drops from 99%→47% (53% relative reduction), without VDB drops to 38% (62% relative reduction), and without multi-agent decomposition drops to 7% (93% relative reduction). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2047.html#e2047.0" class="evidence-link">[e2047.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Offline reusable code generation (SGRL, AURA) achieves comparable or better results with orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than online frequent-query methods (ELLM, AdaRefiner), demonstrating 10-100× computational efficiency advantages. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.0" class="evidence-link">[e2049.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.2" class="evidence-link">[e2049.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.3" class="evidence-link">[e2049.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2047.html#e2047.0" class="evidence-link">[e2047.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Long-horizon success is achievable with proper scaffolding: SGRL unlocks Collect Diamond at 3.7M steps (baselines fail by 5M), CRAFT succeeds on complex coordination (100% Two Arm Lift), WebSynthesis improves multi-step planning (+5.23% from state-transition task). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.0" class="evidence-link">[e2049.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2043.html#e2043.0" class="evidence-link">[e2043.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2052.html#e2052.0" class="evidence-link">[e2052.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Model capability significantly affects curriculum quality: GPT-4o outperforms GPT-3.5 and GLM4-9B in SDW (T=0.290 vs 0.194 vs 0.134), and AURA uses GPT-4.1 for generation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2050.html#e2050.0" class="evidence-link">[e2050.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2047.html#e2047.0" class="evidence-link">[e2047.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Diversity mechanisms are critical: LADDER uses batch generation, temperature cycling, and persona prompts; SGRL uses priority weighting; AURA enforces minimum pool size; their absence leads to repetitive curricula. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2048.html#e2048.0" class="evidence-link">[e2048.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2048.html#e2048.2" class="evidence-link">[e2048.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2049.html#e2049.0" class="evidence-link">[e2049.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2047.html#e2047.0" class="evidence-link">[e2047.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Iterative refinement is essential: CRAFT VLM refinement increases effective curricula ratio, EXIF feedback enables continued improvement while EF plateaus, Self-aware RL difficulty prediction calibrates over 50 steps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2043.html#e2043.0" class="evidence-link">[e2043.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2043.html#e2043.2" class="evidence-link">[e2043.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2045.html#e2045.0" class="evidence-link">[e2045.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2045.html#e2045.2" class="evidence-link">[e2045.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2042.html#e2042.0" class="evidence-link">[e2042.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SEC (adaptive non-LLM curriculum using advantage signals) achieves substantial gains (+13% Countdown, +21% Zebra, +22% ARC-1D, +33% AIME24) without LLM generation, demonstrating that adaptive selection with proper feedback can be highly effective regardless of whether LLMs are used for generation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2053.html#e2053.0" class="evidence-link">[e2053.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying AURA-style schema validation and retrieval augmentation to other LLM curriculum generation systems (e.g., CurricuLLM, Eureka) will increase their training-launch success rates from 12-31% to >80%.</li>
                <li>Converting ELLM and AdaRefiner from frequent online queries to offline reusable code generation (SGRL-style) will reduce computational cost by 10-100× while maintaining or improving performance.</li>
                <li>Combining exploration-first curriculum generation with proposal-first approaches (using proposals to seed exploration) will achieve 50-70% valid data rates, intermediate between pure proposal-first (<30%) and pure exploration-first (70-85%).</li>
                <li>Applying retrieval augmentation (RAG/VDB) to LADDER and TTC-RL will improve their curriculum quality by 10-20% by grounding variant generation in prior successful examples.</li>
                <li>Using GPT-4 class models instead of smaller models (3B-7B) for curriculum generation in SGRL, LADDER, and DSMentor will improve performance by 15-30%.</li>
                <li>Adding explicit diversity mechanisms (batch generation, temperature cycling) to CurricuLLM and Eureka will increase their unique task generation by 2-3× and reduce redundant curricula.</li>
                <li>Implementing iterative VLM-guided refinement loops (CRAFT-style) in AURA and other robotics curriculum systems will increase effective curricula ratio by 20-40%.</li>
                <li>Applying hierarchical decomposition and staged curricula to domains where LLM curricula currently struggle (e.g., STARLING's navigation tasks) will improve long-horizon performance by 30-50%.</li>
                <li>Combining SEC-style advantage-based selection with LLM-generated task proposals will achieve 10-20% better performance than either approach alone by leveraging both adaptive selection and LLM world knowledge.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether LLM-generated curricula with proper validation can match or exceed human expert curricula in highly specialized technical domains requiring deep domain expertise (e.g., advanced theoretical physics, specialized medical procedures, cutting-edge mathematics research).</li>
                <li>Whether the benefits of LLM curricula plateau with current model sizes (GPT-4 level) or continue to improve substantially with 10-100× larger models or fundamentally different architectures.</li>
                <li>Whether LLM-generated curricula can discover fundamentally novel problem-solving strategies not present in their training data, or are limited to recombining and interpolating known patterns.</li>
                <li>Whether offline reusable code generation approaches can be extended to domains without clear compositional structure or verifiable outcomes (e.g., creative tasks, open-ended social interactions, aesthetic judgments).</li>
                <li>Whether the 70-85% valid data rate ceiling for exploration-first approaches can be substantially exceeded through better LLM prompting, world models, or hybrid approaches.</li>
                <li>Whether LLM curricula can adapt effectively to adversarial dynamics, safety-critical constraints, or domains with complex ethical considerations without extensive human oversight.</li>
                <li>Whether the computational cost advantages of offline generation (10-100× fewer LLM calls) can be maintained while achieving the same level of dynamic adaptation as online approaches.</li>
                <li>Whether combining multiple specialized LLMs (e.g., separate models for task generation, difficulty estimation, diversity promotion, and validation) will provide 20-50% gains over single-LLM approaches or introduce coordination overhead that reduces effectiveness.</li>
                <li>Whether non-LLM adaptive curricula (like SEC) can match LLM-based approaches in domains where LLMs currently excel (e.g., code generation, mathematical reasoning) if given equivalent computational resources for optimization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>

    "theory_description": "Large language models can generate highly effective automatic curricula that substantially outperform hand-designed and simple heuristic curricula (1.8-82× improvements) when properly implemented with essential validation mechanisms, but fail catastrophically without them (12-31% success rates). Effectiveness critically depends on: (1) offline reusable code/function generation rather than frequent online queries (10-100× more efficient), (2) mandatory validation mechanisms (schema validation, execution verification, or VLM feedback - removing these causes 52-93% relative performance reductions), (3) retrieval augmentation from prior successful curricula (RAG/VDB), (4) environment-grounded generation (exploration-first with feedback produces 70-85% valid data vs &lt;30% for proposal-first), (5) explicit diversity-promoting mechanisms (batch generation, temperature cycling, persona prompts), and (6) iterative refinement loops. LLM curricula excel in verifiable domains with compositional structure (mathematics, code generation, robotics with proper validation) and can handle long-horizon tasks when combined with hierarchical decomposition and staged curricula. Curriculum generation quality depends significantly on LLM capability (GPT-4 class models substantially outperform smaller models). Note that adaptive non-LLM curricula using on-policy signals (e.g., SEC using advantage-based selection) can also be highly effective, suggesting that the key factors are adaptive selection, proper validation, and domain-appropriate feedback rather than LLM use per se. Without proper implementation methodology, LLM curricula show 12-31% success rates and &lt;30% valid training data, making implementation approach more critical than the use of LLMs alone.",
