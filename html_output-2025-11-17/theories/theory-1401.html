                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Error Correction via Self-Generated Feedback</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of self-generated feedback, where each reflection iteration serves as an error-correction step. The model identifies discrepancies or errors in its previous output, generates feedback or critiques, and uses this information to guide the next answer, resulting in a convergent process toward higher-quality responses.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the model is allowed to reflect for more iterations, answer quality will improve up to a point and then plateau.</li>
                <li>If the feedback generated is of low quality or irrelevant, answer improvement will be limited or may regress.</li>
                <li>If the model is prompted to generate more detailed feedback, the rate of improvement per iteration will increase.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the feedback loop is made explicit in model architecture (e.g., with a dedicated feedback module), convergence may be faster or reach higher-quality optima.</li>
                <li>If the model is exposed to adversarial feedback, it may converge to suboptimal or incorrect answers.</li>
                <li>If the model is trained to recognize when further reflection is unhelpful, it may learn to terminate the process adaptively.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If answer quality does not improve or converge with iterative feedback, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If models cannot generate useful feedback for their own outputs, the feedback loop mechanism is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where feedback is ignored or misapplied by the model are not fully explained. </li>
    <li>The impact of external feedback (e.g., from humans) versus self-generated feedback is not addressed. </li>
