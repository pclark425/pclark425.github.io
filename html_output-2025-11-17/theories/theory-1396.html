                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as Multi-Stage Decorrelation and Error Correction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when prompted to self-reflect and revise, engage in a multi-stage process where each iteration serves to decorrelate the current output from prior errors and biases, while simultaneously correcting errors identified through self-evaluation. The process is analogous to signal denoising and error correction in information theory, where each stage reduces the influence of prior mistakes and increases the alignment of the output with the intended target.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>There may exist a threshold number of reflection passes beyond which further decorrelation and error correction plateau or even reverse due to overcorrection.</li>
