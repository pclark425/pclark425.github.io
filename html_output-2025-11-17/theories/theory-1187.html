                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Guided Retrosynthetic Feasibility in Novel Molecule Generation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when trained on reaction and synthesis data, can internalize retrosynthetic logic and apply it during molecule generation. As a result, LLMs are more likely to generate molecules that are not only novel and application-aligned, but also synthetically accessible, by implicitly or explicitly following learned reaction templates or retrosynthetic pathways.</p>
