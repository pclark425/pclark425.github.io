                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Specialization and Fine-Tuning Theory of Latent Knowledge Extraction in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when fine-tuned on domain-specific scientific corpora, develop internal representations that encode latent knowledge structures, including implicit causal relationships and research trajectories. The theory asserts that the accuracy of LLMs in estimating the probability of future scientific discoveries is a function of their ability to extract, synthesize, and probabilistically reason over these latent structures, which are shaped by the density, diversity, and interconnectedness of the training data.</p>
