                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language model agents can best solve complex, compositional tasks by organizing memory into hierarchical structures, where higher-level abstractions guide retrieval and recombination of lower-level episodic or semantic memories. This enables efficient generalization, transfer, and flexible adaptation to novel task configurations.</p>
