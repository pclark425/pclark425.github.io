                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Belief-Space Planning Theory for Text Environments</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about probabilistic symbolic world models for text environments that integrate LLM uncertainty into planning, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For text-based environments with partial observability, maintaining explicit belief states (probability distributions over possible world states) and planning in belief space significantly improves performance compared to treating observations as complete state descriptions or using no explicit world model. Effective belief-space planning requires: (1) a generative model of state transitions (deterministic or stochastic), (2) an observation model relating states to textual observations, (3) belief update mechanisms (Bayesian filtering, particle filters, or epistemic state updates), and (4) planning algorithms that operate over beliefs (Q_MDP, POMDP solvers, particle filters, or epistemic planners). The benefits are most pronounced in environments with: hidden state, ambiguous observations, long-term dependencies, and information-gathering actions. Discrete belief representations (particle filters, enumerated hypotheses, epistemic models) are tractable for small state spaces, while continuous representations (soft graphs, learned embeddings) or approximations (Q_MDP) are needed for larger spaces. The theory encompasses both probabilistic belief states (distributions over states) and epistemic belief states (sets of possible worlds with indistinguishability relations).</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether learned belief representations (e.g., neural networks) can match hand-designed belief-state models in sample efficiency and interpretability</li>
                <li>The extent to which belief-space planning scales to very large text environments (e.g., open-world games with thousands of objects)</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Finding text environments where belief-state planning provides no benefit over fully-observable planning (e.g., fully observable environments) would define boundary conditions</li>

                <li>Finding cases where discrete belief representations outperform continuous ones in large state spaces would challenge the scalability claims</li>
