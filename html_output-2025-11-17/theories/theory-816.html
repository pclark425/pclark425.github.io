                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Deliberate Memory Control and Self-Improvement Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents can achieve superior task performance and continual self-improvement by actively controlling what, when, and how information is stored, retrieved, and modified in their memory systems. Deliberate memory control involves dynamic selection, abstraction, and transformation of experiences, enabling agents to avoid information overload, reduce interference, and adaptively generalize from past tasks to new ones.</p>
