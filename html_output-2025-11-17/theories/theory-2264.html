                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Metrics Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional set of metrics, encompassing not only empirical adequacy and logical consistency, but also novelty, explanatory power, falsifiability, and ethical/societal impact. The theory asserts that no single metric is sufficient, and that a composite, weighted evaluation across these dimensions is necessary for robust assessment. The theory further suggests that the relative weighting of these metrics should be context-dependent and dynamically adjustable.</p>

                <li>Adjusting metric weights to fit domain priorities will improve evaluator satisfaction and theory adoption.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal set and weighting of metrics for different scientific domains is unknown and may require empirical calibration.</li>
                <li>Overemphasis on certain metrics (e.g., novelty) may inadvertently reduce overall theory quality.</li>
                <li>Automated metric weighting may introduce new forms of bias or overlook important qualitative factors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-metric evaluation consistently outperforms multi-metric approaches, the multi-metric necessity law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If dynamic weighting does not improve evaluation outcomes over static weighting, the contextual weighting law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If multi-metric evaluation leads to inconsistent or contradictory results, the theory's assumptions may be invalid.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to resolve conflicts when metrics are in direct opposition (e.g., high novelty but low empirical adequacy). </li>
    <li>The impact of metric selection and weighting on long-term scientific progress is not considered. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory is closely related to existing work, but its specific focus on LLM-generated theory evaluation and the formalization of dynamic, multi-metric assessment is new.</p>
