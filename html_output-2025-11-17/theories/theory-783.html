                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Implicit Program Induction and Internal Simulation for LLM Arithmetic</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs perform arithmetic by implicitly inducing programs from input text and simulating their execution internally, without explicit symbolic manipulation. The LLM's weights encode statistical regularities of arithmetic operations, enabling the model to generate correct outputs by pattern completion and internalized computation, even in the absence of explicit stepwise reasoning.</p>
