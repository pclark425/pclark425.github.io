                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Latent Chemical Space Navigators</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, through their training on chemical and natural language data, learn a latent representation of chemical space that encodes both structural and functional relationships. When prompted with application-specific objectives, the LLM navigates this latent space to identify and generate novel chemical structures that are likely to fulfill the desired application, effectively acting as a search-and-synthesis engine within a high-dimensional chemical manifold.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>LLMs will be able to generate novel molecules by sampling unexplored regions of their latent space when prompted with novel objectives.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely new classes of molecules by sampling latent space regions not associated with known chemical classes.</li>
                <li>LLMs could generate molecules with emergent properties not present in the training data by navigating to novel latent space regions.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to propose molecules for applications that have no known chemical precedent, if the latent space is sufficiently rich.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate molecules with properties aligned to prompt semantics, the latent-objective alignment law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot interpolate between objectives in prompt space to generate molecules with intermediate properties, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' internal representations do not cluster molecules by property or function, the latent space navigation law would be invalidated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how LLMs handle explicit synthetic feasibility or retrosynthetic accessibility. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain the interpretability of the latent space or how to control sampling in practice. </li>
