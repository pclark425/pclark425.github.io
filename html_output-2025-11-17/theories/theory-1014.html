                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Compression and Retrieval for Efficient LLM Agent Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best solve text game tasks by adaptively compressing and retrieving memory traces based on task relevance and recency. The agent employs a relevance-driven compression mechanism to retain only salient information, discarding or summarizing less relevant details. Retrieval is guided by a dynamic attention mechanism that prioritizes memory traces most likely to impact current decision-making, enabling efficient reasoning even with limited memory resources.</p>
