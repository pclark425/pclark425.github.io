                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Task-Tool Alignment and Modular Augmentation in LLM-Based Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLM-based scientific simulation is determined by the degree of alignment between the representational, procedural, and epistemic requirements of the scientific task (the 'task') and the internal capabilities of the LLM (the 'tool'). When misalignment exists, modular augmentation—via external tools, symbolic modules, or domain-specific adapters—can restore or enhance simulation accuracy. The theory formalizes the interplay between task demands, LLM capabilities, and the role of modular augmentation.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There exists an optimal modular architecture for each scientific subdomain, balancing LLM-native and external capabilities.</li>
                <li>Dynamic, context-sensitive modular augmentation (activated only when needed) will outperform static augmentation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high accuracy on tasks for which they lack the required capabilities and no augmentation is provided, the alignment law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If modular augmentation fails to improve accuracy on tasks requiring the augmented capability, the modular augmentation law is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs use emergent reasoning strategies to compensate for missing capabilities without explicit augmentation. </li>
