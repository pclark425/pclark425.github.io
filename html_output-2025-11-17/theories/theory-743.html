                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Token-Sequence Pattern Matching Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by learning and exploiting statistical patterns in token sequences, rather than by explicit algorithmic computation. Their arithmetic ability is thus limited by the distribution and diversity of arithmetic examples in the training data, and generalization is achieved through interpolation over memorized or frequently observed patterns.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on arithmetic problems with a new format, it will perform well on similar problems but poorly on unseen formats.</li>

                <li>Introducing rare or adversarial arithmetic formats will reduce model accuracy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>With sufficient data augmentation, models may interpolate to more complex arithmetic tasks.</li>
                <li>Hybrid models combining pattern matching and explicit arithmetic modules may overcome interpolation limitations.</li>
                <li>Tokenization schemes that better align with arithmetic structure may improve generalization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model generalizes to arithmetic problems with formats or numbers never seen in training, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If models can extrapolate to arithmetic tasks far outside the training distribution, the theory would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some large models show evidence of stepwise computation, not just pattern matching. </li>
    <li>Chain-of-thought prompting can elicit algorithmic reasoning even for novel formats. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
