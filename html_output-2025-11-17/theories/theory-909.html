                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Compression and Abstraction Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents in text games achieve scalable and efficient memory usage by adaptively compressing and abstracting episodic experiences into higher-level representations, selectively retaining only salient information for future reasoning and planning. The process is guided by task relevance, novelty, and prediction error, enabling agents to balance memory capacity with the need for detailed recall.</p>
