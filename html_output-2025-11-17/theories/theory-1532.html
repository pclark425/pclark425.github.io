                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1532</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Inequality Confinement Principle for Macroscopic FTL Spacetime Engineering</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that quantum inequalities, which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy densities, can be circumvented at macroscopic scales by engineering spacetime regions with synchronized arrays of quantum systems. By phase-aligning negative energy pulses from multiple sources, it is possible to create a persistent, macroscopic region of negative energy suitable for FTL spacetime manipulation, while remaining within the constraints of quantum field theory.</p>
