                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Feature Engineering Superiority in Low-Data Regimes Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the relationship between scientific problem characteristics (including data availability, data structure, problem complexity, domain maturity, and mechanistic understanding requirements) and the applicability, effectiveness, and impact potential of different AI methodologies and approaches, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In scientific problems with limited labeled data (typically <10,000 examples) but substantial domain knowledge, supervised learning with carefully engineered domain-informed features consistently outperforms end-to-end deep learning approaches that learn representations from scratch. The advantage stems from: (1) reducing effective dimensionality by focusing on relevant aspects, (2) incorporating non-local relationships and symmetries that require extensive data to learn, (3) encoding known physical mechanisms and constraints, and (4) providing interpretability that aids scientific validation. This advantage diminishes as data abundance increases, with crossover points typically between 10,000-100,000 labeled examples depending on problem complexity, domain maturity, and the quality of available domain knowledge. The theory applies most strongly to problems where domain expertise can identify discriminative features that capture the underlying physics or mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When labeled data are limited (<10,000 examples) and domain expertise is available to engineer discriminative features, supervised learning with domain-informed features typically provides better performance than end-to-end deep learning that learns representations from scratch.</li>
                <li>The performance advantage of domain features over learned representations decreases with increasing data quantity, with crossover points typically occurring between 10,000-100,000 labeled examples, varying by problem complexity and domain maturity.</li>
                <li>Domain-engineered features that capture non-local relationships, physical symmetries, conservation laws, or multi-scale phenomena provide the largest advantages over raw inputs, as these patterns require prohibitive amounts of data for networks to learn from scratch.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of domain feature engineering depends on the quality, completeness, and correctness of domain knowledge: well-understood domains (physics, chemistry) show larger and more persistent benefits than less mature domains.</li>
                <li>Feature engineering reduces effective sample complexity by orders of magnitude by restricting the hypothesis space to physically meaningful relationships, but this advantage is lost when domain knowledge is incomplete or incorrect.</li>
                <li>The interpretability of engineered features provides additional scientific value beyond predictive performance, enabling validation, hypothesis generation, and trust in low-data regimes where model errors are more likely.</li>
                <li>Hybrid approaches that combine learned representations with domain features can sometimes achieve better performance than either alone, particularly in intermediate data regimes (1,000-50,000 examples).</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A materials property prediction task with 5,000 labeled examples will achieve higher accuracy using engineered composition-based descriptors and structural motifs than a graph neural network trained end-to-end on crystal structures, but the GNN will surpass it beyond ~50,000 examples.</li>
                <li>In drug discovery, a QSAR model with 1,000 labeled compounds using engineered molecular descriptors (fingerprints, physicochemical properties) will outperform a graph neural network by 10-20% in predictive accuracy, but the GNN will match or exceed it when data exceed 50,000 compounds.</li>
                <li>For a new protein function prediction task with 500 labeled examples, features based on sequence motifs, domain annotations, and physicochemical properties will outperform a transformer model trained from scratch on sequences by at least 15% in classification accuracy.</li>
                <li>In climate modeling with 2,000 labeled simulation outputs, a model using engineered features based on physical principles (energy balance, conservation laws) will outperform a pure CNN by 20-30% in prediction error.</li>
                <li>For a spectroscopy inverse problem with 3,000 labeled spectra, engineered features based on peak positions, widths, and ratios will enable better structure prediction than an end-to-end neural network.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether automated feature learning methods (e.g., self-supervised pretraining, meta-learning across related tasks) can match or exceed human expert feature engineering in low-data regimes (<1,000 examples), or if human domain knowledge provides irreplaceable inductive biases that cannot be learned from data alone.</li>
                <li>The exact functional form of the data-quantity crossover curve where deep learning surpasses feature engineering, whether it follows a universal scaling law (e.g., power law) across scientific domains, or if it is fundamentally domain-specific.</li>
                <li>Whether foundation models pretrained on large unlabeled scientific corpora can overcome the low-data limitations of end-to-end learning and match or exceed expert feature engineering with minimal fine-tuning (<100 examples), or if they still require substantial labeled data.</li>
                <li>If there exists an optimal hybrid architecture that can automatically learn when to rely on domain features versus learned representations as a function of available data, or if this trade-off must be manually tuned per problem.</li>
                <li>Whether the interpretability advantage of engineered features provides measurable scientific value (e.g., faster hypothesis generation, fewer experimental failures) beyond predictive performance, and if this value can be quantified.</li>
                <li>If active learning strategies that leverage domain features for sample selection can reduce the crossover point by an order of magnitude (e.g., from 50,000 to 5,000 examples) by strategically acquiring the most informative labels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding scientific problems where end-to-end deep learning consistently outperforms domain feature engineering even with <1,000 labeled examples across multiple independent datasets would challenge the theory's core premise.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that automatically learned features from self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled scientific data match or exceed expert features in low-data regimes (<5,000 examples) across multiple domains would weaken the necessity of domain expertise.</li>
                <li>Showing that the crossover point occurs at much lower data quantities (<1,000 examples) across multiple well-characterized scientific domains would challenge the stated thresholds and suggest the theory overestimates the data requirements of deep learning.</li>
                <li>Finding cases where incorrect or incomplete domain knowledge leads to engineered features that perform worse than learned representations even in very low-data regimes (<500 examples) would highlight critical failure modes.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that hybrid approaches combining domain features with learned representations consistently underperform pure domain feature approaches in low-data regimes would challenge the theory's prediction about hybrid methods.</li>
                <li>Showing that the interpretability advantage of domain features does not translate to measurable scientific benefits (e.g., faster discovery, better generalization to new conditions) would weaken the theory's claims about scientific value beyond prediction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to optimally combine domain features with learned representations in hybrid approaches, or provide principles for when each should be weighted more heavily </li>
    <li>The role of data quality, noise levels, label reliability, and measurement error in determining the crossover point is not fully characterized; high-quality small datasets may favor features while noisy large datasets may favor robust learned representations </li>
    <li>How transfer learning, multi-task learning, and meta-learning affect the data requirements for deep learning approaches and potentially shift the crossover point <a href="../results/extraction-result-2272.html#e2272.1" class="evidence-link">[e2272.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2362.html#e2362.0" class="evidence-link">[e2362.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The computational cost trade-offs between feature engineering (often cheap inference, expensive design) and deep learning (expensive training, cheap inference) and how this affects practical applicability </li>
    <li>How problem complexity (dimensionality, non-linearity, number of relevant features) quantitatively affects the crossover point; more complex problems may favor learned representations even with less data </li>
    <li>The role of multi-fidelity data (abundant cheap low-fidelity data plus scarce expensive high-fidelity labels) in changing the dynamics of the feature engineering vs. deep learning trade-off <a href="../results/extraction-result-2313.html#e2313.6" class="evidence-link">[e2313.6]</a> </li>
    <li>How active learning and strategic data acquisition strategies interact with the choice between engineered and learned features, and whether they can reduce data requirements differently for each approach <a href="../results/extraction-result-2336.html#e2336.12" class="evidence-link">[e2336.12]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2325.html#e2325.6" class="evidence-link">[e2325.6]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how the availability of related unlabeled data (for self-supervised pretraining) affects the comparison, as this can dramatically improve learned representations without requiring more labels </li>
