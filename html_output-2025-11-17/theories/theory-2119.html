                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2119</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Consensus Theory of LLM-Based Scientific Law Extraction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can extract robust scientific laws from large scholarly corpora by identifying emergent consensus patterns—statements, relationships, or regularities that recur across diverse sources and contexts. The LLM aggregates, weighs, and reconciles evidence from multiple papers, using both explicit frequency and implicit semantic similarity, to distill laws that reflect the collective knowledge and agreement of the scientific community, while also flagging areas of controversy or uncertainty.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to identify consensus patterns in a corpus with clear majority agreement, the emergent consensus law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot distinguish between high- and low-quality sources, the weighted aggregation law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLMs assign high confidence to laws with little or conflicting support, the theory is called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how LLMs handle novel or minority viewpoints that may later become mainstream. </li>
