                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Factor Alignment Theory with Calibration and Bias Control</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about alignment between proxy evaluations (LLM-as-a-judge, Likert-style) and expert human review for software development artifacts, including necessary conditions for high agreement.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that alignment between LLM-based proxy evaluations and expert human review for software development artifacts is determined by the interaction of four primary factors operating through both bottleneck and synergistic mechanisms: (1) Evaluation Criterion Objectivity (ECO) - the degree to which evaluation criteria can be operationalized into observable, verifiable features, quantifiable through inter-expert agreement; (2) Calibration Fidelity (CF) - the extent to which the LLM has been calibrated on representative examples with known expert judgments, following a logarithmic improvement curve; (3) Bias Mitigation Strength (BMS) - the effectiveness of mechanisms controlling for systematic biases (position, verbosity, self-preference) in both LLM and human evaluations; and (4) Artifact Evaluability (AE) - the inherent characteristics of the software artifact (complexity, domain-specificity, structural clarity) that make it amenable to consistent evaluation. The theory proposes a dual-mechanism model: high alignment requires threshold levels in all four factors (bottleneck effect), while above-threshold performance exhibits multiplicative synergies, particularly between calibration and bias control. The theory further specifies that evaluation framework design (Likert scale granularity, dimensional decomposition) modulates the expression of these factors. Critically, calibration and bias control are interdependent - effective calibration must explicitly model and correct bias patterns to achieve synergistic gains, with properly integrated approaches yielding 40-67% better alignment than calibration alone.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Alignment score A between LLM and expert evaluations follows a dual-mechanism model: A = B(ECO, CF, BMS, AE) × S(ECO, CF, BMS, AE), where B represents bottleneck effects (weakest-link constraint) and S represents synergistic amplification above thresholds.</li>
                <li>The bottleneck function B can be approximated as: B = (min(ECO, CF, BMS, AE))^k, where k ≥ 1 represents the severity of the bottleneck effect (typically k = 1.5-2.0 for software artifacts).</li>
                <li>For high alignment (A > 0.8 on correlation metrics like Pearson's r or Spearman's ρ), all four factors must exceed empirically-derived threshold values. These thresholds are theoretical predictions: ECO > 0.7, CF > 0.75, BMS > 0.7, AE > 0.65.</li>
                <li>Calibration Fidelity (CF) increases logarithmically with the number of calibration examples up to a saturation point determined by artifact diversity: CF = min(α × log(N + 1) / log(N_sat + 1), 1.0), where N is the number of calibration examples, N_sat is the saturation point (typically 50-200 for homogeneous artifact types, 200-500 for diverse types), and α is a scaling constant (typically 0.8-0.95).</li>
                <li>Bias Mitigation Strength (BMS) and Calibration Fidelity (CF) exhibit multiplicative synergistic effects: effective_alignment_contribution = (CF × BMS)^β, where β represents the synergy coefficient (typically 1.15-1.35), meaning integrated calibration-bias-control approaches yield 1.4-1.67× better results than calibration alone.</li>
                <li>Evaluation Criterion Objectivity (ECO) can be quantified through inter-expert agreement: ECO ≈ (IEA - baseline) / (1 - baseline), where IEA is inter-expert agreement (e.g., Fleiss' kappa or ICC) and baseline is chance agreement (typically 0.2-0.3 for Likert scales).</li>
                <li>Artifact Evaluability (AE) decreases with both cyclomatic complexity and domain-specificity: AE = 1 / (1 + γ₁ × normalized_complexity + γ₂ × domain_specificity + γ₃ × normalized_complexity × domain_specificity), where γ₁, γ₂, γ₃ are empirically determined constants and the interaction term captures compounding effects.</li>
                <li>When any single factor falls below its threshold, alignment degrades super-linearly: degradation_rate ∝ (threshold - actual_value)^2, creating a sharp performance cliff.</li>
                <li>Calibration without explicit bias control yields suboptimal results: alignment_calibration_only ≈ 0.6-0.7 × alignment_calibration+bias_control, representing a 30-40% performance gap.</li>
                <li>The optimal Likert scale granularity for maximizing LLM-human alignment is 5-7 points for most software artifacts, balancing discriminative power against rating consistency. Scales with <5 points lose discriminative power; scales with >7 points introduce noise without improving alignment.</li>
                <li>Multi-dimensional evaluations with 3-5 specific criteria show 20-35% higher alignment than single holistic scores for complex software artifacts (complexity > median), with diminishing returns beyond 5 dimensions due to cognitive load and inter-dimension correlation.</li>
                <li>The synergistic effect between CF and BMS is strongest when bias correction is integrated into the calibration process itself (learning bias-corrected evaluation patterns) rather than applied post-hoc, yielding an additional 10-15% improvement.</li>
                <li>Inter-expert agreement (IEA) sets a practical upper bound on achievable LLM-human alignment: max_achievable_alignment ≈ IEA × 0.9-0.95, accounting for irreducible differences between human and LLM evaluation processes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Studies show that LLM evaluations align better with human judgments when evaluation criteria are clearly defined and operationalized into specific, observable features rather than abstract qualities, demonstrating the importance of Evaluation Criterion Objectivity. </li>
    <li>Calibration of LLMs on domain-specific examples with expert annotations significantly improves agreement with human evaluators in specialized domains, supporting the Calibration Fidelity factor. </li>
    <li>Systematic biases in LLM evaluations (such as position bias, verbosity bias, and self-preference bias) significantly reduce alignment with human judgments when not controlled, establishing the necessity of Bias Mitigation Strength. </li>
    <li>Human expert agreement levels set an upper bound on LLM-human alignment - when experts disagree substantially, LLM alignment with any single expert will be limited, providing a natural ceiling for ECO. </li>
    <li>Software artifacts with higher structural complexity and domain-specificity show lower LLM-human alignment compared to simpler, more general artifacts, supporting the Artifact Evaluability factor. </li>
    <li>Likert-scale design choices (number of points, anchor descriptions) affect both human and LLM rating distributions and their alignment, indicating that evaluation framework design modulates factor expression. </li>
    <li>Multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that decompose overall quality into specific aspects show higher LLM-human alignment than single holistic scores, demonstrating that dimensional decomposition improves ECO. </li>
    <li>Explicit bias correction mechanisms (such as reference-free evaluation, blind evaluation, and ensemble methods) improve LLM-human alignment, validating the importance of BMS. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For code review comments (high ECO due to clear criteria, moderate AE), implementing calibration on 50-100 expert-annotated examples combined with position bias control will achieve LLM-human alignment of r > 0.75, with saturation around 150 examples.</li>
                <li>For API documentation quality (high ECO, high AE due to clear structure), a 5-point Likert scale with detailed anchor descriptions will show 15-25% higher LLM-human alignment than a 10-point scale with minimal anchors, due to reduced rating noise.</li>
                <li>Software architecture design evaluations (low ECO due to subjective criteria, low AE due to complexity) will show poor LLM-human alignment (r < 0.5) even with extensive calibration, unless evaluation criteria are decomposed into 5+ specific, objective sub-criteria, which should raise ECO above threshold.</li>
                <li>Ensemble methods combining 3-5 LLM evaluators with different prompting strategies will reduce variance in bias patterns and improve alignment by 10-20% compared to single LLM evaluation, effectively increasing BMS.</li>
                <li>For unit test quality assessment (high ECO due to measurable criteria, high AE due to structural clarity), calibration on 30 examples per quality dimension will achieve 85-90% of maximum possible alignment, with minimal gains (<5%) beyond 50 examples per dimension due to saturation effects.</li>
                <li>Implementing integrated bias-aware calibration (where calibration examples explicitly demonstrate bias-free evaluation patterns) will yield 40-50% better alignment than sequential calibration-then-bias-correction approaches for moderate-complexity artifacts.</li>
                <li>For artifacts where inter-expert agreement is high (IEA > 0.8), LLM-human alignment can reach r > 0.85 with proper calibration and bias control, approaching the theoretical ceiling of 0.9-0.95 × IEA.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If calibration examples are selected to maximize diversity in bias patterns (rather than artifact diversity), alignment might improve by 30-50% with 40-60% fewer total examples by more efficiently learning bias correction, but this could lead to overfitting to bias patterns at the expense of domain coverage, potentially reducing generalization to novel artifact types.</li>
                <li>Implementing real-time adaptive calibration where the LLM updates its evaluation strategy based on ongoing expert feedback might achieve near-perfect alignment (r > 0.95) for routine artifacts by continuously optimizing CF, but could destabilize evaluations for novel artifact types and introduce temporal inconsistency in evaluation standards.</li>
                <li>Creating a 'bias fingerprint' for each expert evaluator and calibrating LLMs to match individual expert biases might achieve higher individual alignment (potentially r > 0.9 for specific experts) but lower consensus alignment across experts - the net effect on evaluation utility and whether this improves or harms practical deployment is unclear.</li>
                <li>If Artifact Evaluability (AE) could be automatically predicted before evaluation using static analysis metrics, routing low-AE artifacts to human-only evaluation and high-AE artifacts to LLM evaluation might optimize resource allocation by 40-60%, but the optimal threshold for routing and overall system performance across diverse artifact distributions is uncertain.</li>
                <li>Combining LLM evaluations with automated static analysis metrics in a learned weighted ensemble might break through the ceiling imposed by low ECO by providing objective anchors, potentially achieving alignment r > 0.7 even for subjective criteria, but the generalizability across artifact types and whether this fundamentally changes the theory's factor structure is unknown.</li>
                <li>If the synergy coefficient β between CF and BMS could be increased through novel training approaches (e.g., meta-learning across multiple calibration-bias-control scenarios), alignment might improve by 50-100% beyond current predictions, but whether such approaches exist and their practical feasibility is unknown.</li>
                <li>Applying the theory to cross-cultural evaluation contexts might reveal that cultural factors introduce a fifth factor (Cultural Alignment) that interacts with ECO and BMS, potentially requiring 2-3× more calibration data for international teams, but the magnitude and structure of these effects is uncertain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If high-quality calibration (100+ diverse examples, covering full artifact space) fails to improve alignment beyond baseline for high-ECO (>0.8), high-AE (>0.7) artifacts, this would challenge the theory's emphasis on Calibration Fidelity as a necessary factor and suggest other unmeasured factors dominate.</li>
                <li>If removing all bias control mechanisms while maintaining high calibration still achieves alignment > 0.8 for artifacts with known bias susceptibility, this would contradict the theory's claim that BMS is a necessary factor with multiplicative effects.</li>
                <li>If alignment for low-AE artifacts (highly complex, domain-specific, AE < 0.5) reaches levels comparable to high-AE artifacts (within 10% difference) through any combination of calibration and bias control, this would challenge the bottleneck model and suggest AE is not a fundamental constraint.</li>
                <li>If single holistic evaluations consistently outperform multi-dimensional evaluations (by >10%) for complex artifacts across multiple studies, this would contradict the theory's prediction about decomposition benefits and the relationship between dimensional structure and ECO.</li>
                <li>If inter-expert agreement (IEA) and LLM-human alignment are found to be uncorrelated (r < 0.3) across multiple artifact types and evaluation contexts, this would challenge the theory's use of IEA as a proxy for ECO and as an upper bound on alignment.</li>
                <li>If increasing calibration examples beyond the predicted saturation point (N_sat) continues to improve alignment linearly or super-linearly rather than logarithmically plateauing, this would challenge the proposed functional form of CF and suggest different learning dynamics.</li>
                <li>If the synergy coefficient β between CF and BMS is found to be ≤1.0 (no synergy or negative interaction) across multiple empirical studies, this would contradict the core claim of multiplicative benefits from integrated approaches.</li>
                <li>If artifacts with very low ECO (<0.5, high expert disagreement) can still achieve high LLM-human alignment (>0.75) through calibration alone, this would challenge the bottleneck model and the necessity of threshold ECO values.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The temporal stability of LLM evaluations - whether alignment degrades over time as software practices evolve, programming paradigms shift, or LLM training data becomes outdated relative to current development practices. The theory does not specify how CF and ECO might decay over time. </li>
    <li>The role of evaluator expertise level - whether alignment differs systematically between junior and senior expert evaluators, which level LLMs align with more closely by default, and whether calibration should target specific expertise levels. This could affect the interpretation of ECO and optimal calibration strategies. </li>
    <li>Cross-cultural and linguistic factors in evaluation alignment for international software development teams, including whether evaluation criteria objectivity (ECO) varies across cultures and whether calibration requirements differ for multilingual contexts. </li>
    <li>The impact of evaluation context and stakes - whether alignment differs between low-stakes research evaluations and high-stakes production deployment decisions, and whether evaluator motivation and attention affect the practical expression of the four factors. </li>
    <li>The role of LLM model size, architecture, and training approach on the functional forms of CF and BMS - whether different model families require different calibration strategies or exhibit different bias patterns that affect the theory's quantitative predictions. </li>
    <li>The interaction between artifact version evolution and calibration stability - whether calibration on version N of an artifact generalizes to version N+1, and how the magnitude of changes affects CF degradation. </li>
