                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Error Correction and Representation Refinement</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that iterative self-reflection in language models operates hierarchically, with early passes correcting surface-level errors (e.g., grammar, factuality), and later passes addressing deeper, more abstract issues (e.g., reasoning, coherence). Each stage refines the internal representation of the problem and the output, leading to a layered improvement process.</p>
