                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Driven Memory Allocation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language model agents achieve optimal performance by allocating memory resources in proportion to the anticipated utility of information for current and future tasks. The agent should estimate the expected value of storing, retrieving, or discarding information based on task structure, uncertainty, and the likelihood of future reuse, leading to a form of rational, utility-maximizing memory management.</p>
