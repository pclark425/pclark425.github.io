                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Self-Evaluation and Internal Representation Alignment</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, during generate-then-reflect cycles, engage in a hierarchical self-evaluation process. At each reflection step, the model aligns its internal representations of the problem, answer, and evaluation criteria, recursively updating its beliefs and solution structure. This alignment process enables the model to iteratively reduce internal inconsistencies and improve answer quality, even in the absence of external feedback.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
