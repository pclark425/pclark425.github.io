                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid and Hierarchical Memory Architecture Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model (LLM) agents achieve optimal task performance by employing a hybrid memory system that integrates multiple memory types (short-term, episodic, semantic, and procedural) organized in a hierarchical architecture. This structure enables efficient retrieval, abstraction, and generalization, allowing agents to dynamically allocate, consolidate, and utilize memories at different levels of abstraction and timescales.</p>
