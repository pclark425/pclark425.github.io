                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1526</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Transient Metric Tunneling via High-Intensity Electromagnetic Field Manipulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory suggests that by using ultra-intense, rapidly modulated electromagnetic fields in conjunction with advanced materials, it is possible to induce transient, localized changes in the spacetime metric—effectively creating 'metric tunnels' that allow information or matter to traverse distances at apparent superluminal speeds. The approach leverages nonlinear quantum electrodynamics and vacuum polarization effects, and is designed to be feasible with near-future high-power laser and nanofabrication technologies.</p>
