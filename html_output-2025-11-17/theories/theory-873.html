                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Management via Relevance and Utility Estimation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents optimize memory usage and task performance by continuously estimating the relevance and utility of memory items. The agent actively prunes, compresses, or refreshes memory based on predicted future utility for current and anticipated tasks. This process prevents memory overload, prioritizes high-value information, and enables adaptive forgetting, leading to more efficient and effective task completion.</p>
