                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1945</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Guided Hypothesis Testing</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can not only distill qualitative laws from large scholarly corpora, but can iteratively refine these laws by generating hypotheses, testing them against the corpus, and updating the distilled laws based on counterexamples or supporting evidence. This process mimics aspects of the scientific method, with the LLM acting as both hypothesis generator and evaluator, leading to increasingly robust and generalizable qualitative laws.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may autonomously discover previously unknown exceptions or special cases to established scientific laws.</li>
                <li>LLMs could develop novel, more general laws by synthesizing and refining across multiple rounds of hypothesis testing.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to improve law accuracy or generality through iterative refinement, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot identify counterexamples or exceptions in the corpus, the theory's assumptions about hypothesis testing are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The impact of LLM hallucinations or overfitting to spurious patterns during iterative refinement is not fully addressed. </li>
