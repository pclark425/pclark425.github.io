                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1876</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Probabilistic Inference Theory for LLM Scientific Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, through their training on vast corpora of scientific text, develop emergent probabilistic inference capabilities that allow them to estimate the likelihood of future discoveries. These capabilities arise from the model's internalization of historical patterns of scientific progress, citation dynamics, and the language of prediction, enabling the LLM to generate calibrated probability estimates for future events even in the absence of explicit training for forecasting.</p>
