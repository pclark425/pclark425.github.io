                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1535</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Inequality Confinement Principle for Macroscopic FTL Spacetime Engineering</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that the constraints imposed by quantum inequalities on negative energy densities can be circumvented or effectively managed through engineered quantum systems, enabling the creation and confinement of macroscopic regions of negative energy sufficient for faster-than-light (FTL) spacetime manipulation. By leveraging advanced quantum field configurations, such as squeezed states, dynamical Casimir effects, and quantum coherence, it becomes possible to stabilize and localize negative energy in a manner compatible with the energy requirements of FTL spacetime geometries (e.g., warp bubbles or traversable wormholes) within realistic technological and budgetary constraints.</p>
