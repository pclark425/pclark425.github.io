                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Law Induction via Domain-Specialized LLM Fine-Tuning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models, when fine-tuned on large, high-quality, domain-specific scientific corpora, can internalize and distill qualitative laws, heuristics, and domain-specific rules directly from the literature, even without explicit retrieval augmentation or multi-agent feedback. The fine-tuning process enables the LLM to encode domain heuristics, procedural rules, and empirical regularities, which can be surfaced via prompting or structured extraction. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the scale, diversity, and quality of the fine-tuning corpus, as well as the alignment of the model's architecture and objectives with the target domain.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fine-tuning a general LLM on a new, large, high-quality domain corpus (e.g., climate science) will enable the model to generate domain-specific qualitative laws and heuristics not present in the base model.</li>
