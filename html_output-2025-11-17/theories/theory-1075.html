                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Internal Simulation for Spatial Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when solving spatial puzzle games, develop internal simulation-like processes that allow them to mentally manipulate and evaluate possible puzzle states. Rather than relying solely on pattern completion, the model uses its attention and memory mechanisms to simulate the consequences of different moves or placements, akin to a form of implicit search or planning. This emergent simulation is not explicitly programmed but arises from the model's architecture and training on sequential data.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may develop explicit planning strategies if trained with feedback on multi-step spatial puzzles.</li>
                <li>Emergent simulation capabilities may generalize to non-spatial domains requiring sequential reasoning.</li>

            <ol>

                <li>If attention patterns do not correspond to plausible move sequences, the theory would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well without the ability to simulate or track state transitions, the theory would be undermined.</li>
