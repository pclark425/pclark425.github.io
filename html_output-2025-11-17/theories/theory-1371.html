                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1371</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Control Theory of LLM Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, during generate-then-reflect cycles, engage in a form of meta-cognitive control, dynamically allocating attention and reasoning resources to aspects of their output that are most likely to benefit from revision. The process is guided by internal uncertainty estimates and error heuristics, enabling targeted improvement rather than uniform revision.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>If a model is prompted to reflect, it will focus revision on segments where it expresses uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Reflection will be more effective on errors that match the model's internal heuristics.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained with new heuristics, their reflection focus will shift accordingly.</li>
                <li>If uncertainty estimation is disabled, reflection will become less targeted and less effective.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If reflection is equally distributed across all output segments regardless of uncertainty, the theory is falsified.</li>
