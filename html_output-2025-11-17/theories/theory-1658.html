                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Tool-Augmented Simulation: Externalization of Domain-Specific Reasoning and Computation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the primary factor affecting the accuracy of LLM-based scientific simulation is the degree to which domain-specific reasoning and computation are externalized to specialized tools. The more an LLM can delegate complex, domain-specific tasks (e.g., mathematical calculation, chemical structure analysis, code execution) to reliable external tools, the more accurate and robust its simulation becomes. This externalization reduces the cognitive load on the LLM, mitigates its inherent limitations in symbolic reasoning, and enables it to act as an orchestrator of specialized processes rather than a sole problem-solver.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs with access to reliable tools do not outperform LLM-alone baselines on domain-specific simulation tasks, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing the number or specialization of tools does not improve simulation accuracy, the externalization principle is called into question.</li>
