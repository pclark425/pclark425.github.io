                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1587</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Spacetime Engineering for FTL Travel</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that spacetime can be engineered at macroscopic scales by leveraging collective quantum and electromagnetic effects in structured materials, enabling the creation of effective metrics that allow for apparent faster-than-light (FTL) travel. Rather than requiring exotic matter or astronomical energy, the theory suggests that emergent properties of complex systems—such as topological phases, quantum coherence, and nonlocal electromagnetic responses—can be harnessed to locally modify the propagation of information and matter, making FTL travel feasible within realistic technological and budgetary constraints.</p>
