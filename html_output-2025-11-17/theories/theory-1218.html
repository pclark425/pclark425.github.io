                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Abstraction-Driven Chemical Creativity in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, by abstracting chemical syntax and functional group patterns from diverse training data, can recombine these abstractions in novel ways to generate molecules for new applications and chemical classes. The LLM's internal representations allow it to traverse chemical space creatively, guided by prompts specifying application or property constraints.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Prompting an LLM with a property constraint (e.g., high solubility) will yield molecules with structural features associated with that property, even in new chemical classes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely new classes of functional group combinations with emergent properties not present in the training data.</li>
                <li>Prompt-guided LLMs could generate molecules with properties that are not linearly predictable from known motifs, indicating creative abstraction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generate molecules with novel motif combinations for new applications, the abstraction-recombination law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If prompt-guided LLMs fail to sample new regions of chemical space, the prompt-traversal law is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain the limits of LLM abstraction, such as when chemical rules are violated or when motifs are incompatible. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends known LLM capabilities to a new domain (chemistry) and proposes creative recombination as a mechanism for zero-shot molecule generation.</p>
