                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional approach, integrating semantic, empirical, methodological, and novelty-based criteria. It asserts that only by considering these dimensions in concert can the scientific value and reliability of LLM-generated theories be robustly assessed.</p>

    <li>Predictive power is a central criterion in scientific theory evaluation, distinguishing scientific from non-scientific theories. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-generated theories evaluated using all four dimensions (semantic, empirical, methodological, novelty) will correlate more strongly with expert acceptance than those evaluated on a single dimension.</li>
                <li>Automated systems that measure predictive power will more effectively filter out tautological or vacuous theories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal weighting of each evaluation dimension may vary by scientific domain and could be learned adaptively.</li>
                <li>Some highly novel but true theories may initially score poorly on empirical or plausibility metrics, but high on novelty.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If theories passing all four evaluation dimensions are consistently rejected by experts, the theory's sufficiency is undermined.</li>
                <li>If predictive power does not distinguish between valuable and non-valuable LLM-generated theories, the centrality of this criterion is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of social or institutional biases in automated evaluation is not addressed. </li>
