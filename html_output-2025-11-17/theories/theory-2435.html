                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2435</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Hub Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that neuronal populations within the visual cortex that serve as network hubs—characterized by high synaptic connectivity, elevated metabolic demand, and centrality in information flow—are selectively vulnerable to amyloid-β and tau pathology due to increased exposure to toxic protein species, higher oxidative stress, and greater reliance on proteostatic mechanisms. The theory further suggests that these features amplify the local accumulation and propagation of pathological aggregates, leading to early and severe degeneration in these populations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the connectivity of a normally resistant neuronal population (e.g., via optogenetic stimulation and synaptogenesis) will render it more vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Selective ablation of hub neurons in early AD will slow the spread of pathology to other regions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a neuronal population with high connectivity and metabolic demand does not show increased vulnerability to Aβ and tau pathology, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If reducing metabolic demand in hub neurons does not alter their vulnerability, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>Some low-connectivity, low-metabolic neurons are also affected in late-stage AD, which is not fully explained by this theory. </li>
