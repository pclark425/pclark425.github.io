                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Error Signal Propagation and Correction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when prompted to reflect, propagate error signals through their internal representations, allowing for iterative correction of reasoning chains. Each reflection step acts as a feedback loop, enabling the model to identify, localize, and correct errors in a manner analogous to error backpropagation in neural networks, but occurring at inference time through prompt-driven self-supervision.</p>

                <li>If reflection is applied to chain-of-thought reasoning, corrections will localize to specific steps rather than the entire output.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained to explicitly propagate error signals during reflection, they may develop more efficient self-correction strategies.</li>
                <li>If reflection is applied to models with different architectures (e.g., RNNs vs. Transformers), the effectiveness of error signal propagation may differ.</li>
                <li>If reflection is combined with external feedback, the interplay between self-generated and externally-provided error signals may lead to novel correction dynamics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative reflection does not lead to improved accuracy, the theory's mechanism is called into question.</li>
                <li>If models are unable to localize errors to specific reasoning steps, the analogy to error signal propagation is weakened.</li>
                <li>If error signals do not propagate through the reasoning chain, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain cases where errors persist despite multiple rounds of reflection. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for cases where reflection leads to overfitting to spurious patterns. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
