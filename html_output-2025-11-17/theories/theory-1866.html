                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Hypothesis Aggregation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by implicitly aggregating latent hypotheses and research trajectories embedded in their training data. The LLM's outputs reflect a synthesis of the 'collective anticipation' of the scientific community, as encoded in published hypotheses, open questions, and research trends, allowing the model to probabilistically forecast which discoveries are most likely to occur.</p>

                <li>LLMs trained on interdisciplinary literature may forecast cross-field discoveries more accurately than domain-specific models.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to assign higher probabilities to discoveries that are the focus of converging research hypotheses, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot aggregate multiple lines of evidence to forecast likely discoveries, the theory would be undermined.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The theory does not account for the impact of non-textual data (e.g., experimental results, figures) on LLM forecasts. </li>
    <li>LLMs may not capture tacit knowledge or unpublished research directions. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
