                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by organizing memory into hierarchical structures, where different levels of memory encode information at varying temporal and semantic scales. Agents should learn to store, abstract, and retrieve information at the appropriate level of granularity, enabling efficient reasoning, generalization, and transfer across tasks.</p>
