                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Decomposition and Iterative Composition Law (General-Quantitative Extension)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the general law by introducing quantitative relationships between the depth of decomposition, the number of composition steps, and the logical accuracy of language models. It posits that there exists an optimal granularity of decomposition and a threshold for iterative composition beyond which logical accuracy plateaus or declines due to model limitations.</p>
