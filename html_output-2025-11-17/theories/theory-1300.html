                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1300</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Motif-Driven Locality Enhancement Theory for Hard Graph Problems</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that ideal graph-to-text representations for language model training on hard graph problems should explicitly encode local motif structures (such as cycles, cliques, stars, and other recurring subgraphs) and their interrelations. By foregrounding these motifs and their constraints, such representations enable language models to more effectively learn and generalize the combinatorial and constraint-propagation properties that underlie hard graph problems, leading to improved performance, generalization, and robustness compared to representations that only encode global or edge-level information.</p>
