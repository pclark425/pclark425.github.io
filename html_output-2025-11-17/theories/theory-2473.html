                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2473</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Cellular Vulnerability Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from a multidimensional gradient of intrinsic and extrinsic cellular properties. These include metabolic demand, synaptic connectivity, gene expression profiles (especially those related to proteostasis, oxidative stress, and immune signaling), and local microenvironmental factors (such as glial support and vascularization). The interplay of these factors determines a neuron's position on a vulnerability-resistance spectrum, with those at the high-risk end accumulating pathology and degenerating earlier in dementia.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high predicted vulnerability do not develop pathology earlier or more severely, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If manipulation of a single factor (e.g., metabolic demand) is sufficient to confer resistance regardless of other factors, the gradient model is called into question.</li>
