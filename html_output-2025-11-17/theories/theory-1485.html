                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is represented along a continuum between modal (sensory-motor grounded) and amodal (abstract, symbolic) formats. Rather than being strictly one or the other, most concepts are dynamically hybridized, with the proportion of modal and amodal content flexibly shifting according to context, task demands, and individual experience. This dynamic hybridization allows the brain to efficiently integrate perceptual grounding with abstract reasoning, supporting both concrete and abstract thought within a unified representational framework.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging studies show that both sensory-motor and association cortices are activated during conceptual processing, with the balance varying by concept and context. </li>
    <li>Behavioral priming and interference effects indicate that both perceptual and abstract features are accessed during concept use. </li>
    <li>Lesion studies reveal that damage to either sensory-motor or association areas can selectively impair different aspects of conceptual knowledge. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to hub-and-spoke and hybrid models, this law formalizes the representational format as a true continuum and emphasizes dynamic, context-sensitive hybridization.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hybrid and distributed models (e.g., hub-and-spoke) propose both modal and amodal contributions to conceptual representation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of a graded continuum, rather than discrete categories, and the formalization of dynamic hybridization as a core principle is novel.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>fMRI and MEG studies show rapid shifts in the neural substrates of concept processing when tasks emphasize perceptual versus abstract features. </li>
    <li>Behavioral studies demonstrate that feature verification and property generation are faster when the context matches the dominant feature type (modal or amodal). </li>
    <li>Patients with selective deficits (e.g., semantic dementia, agnosia) can sometimes compensate by relying more on the intact (modal or amodal) system. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends context-dependent reweighting to the representational format of conceptual knowledge, formalizing it as a core property.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Task-dependent reweighting is known in attention and perception; some hybrid models allow for context effects.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law's explicit claim that hybridization is dynamic and context-sensitive, not static, is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Concepts with high perceptual salience will show greater activation in sensory-motor areas, while abstract concepts will show more association cortex activation, with intermediate cases showing mixed patterns.</li>
                <li>Manipulating task context to emphasize perceptual or abstract features will shift both neural activation and behavioral performance accordingly.</li>
                <li>Individuals with greater expertise in a domain will show more flexible hybridization, adjusting the modal-amodal balance more rapidly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially biasing the modal-amodal ratio (e.g., via neurostimulation) will alter subjective conceptual experience and performance.</li>
                <li>Developmental or cross-cultural differences in education will produce systematic shifts in the modal-amodal continuum for certain concepts.</li>
                <li>Machine learning models that implement dynamic hybridization will better predict human conceptual behavior than static models.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts are always represented with a fixed set of features regardless of context, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If no evidence of dynamic reconfiguration in neural or behavioral data is found, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If concepts can be fully explained by either purely modal or purely amodal representations, the continuum hypothesis would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise computational mechanisms for dynamic hybridization are not fully specified. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how new concepts are initially placed on the continuum during learning. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
