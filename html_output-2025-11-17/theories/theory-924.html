                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured and Modular Memory Enables Generalization and Robustness in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents equipped with structured and modular memory systems—where memory is organized into distinct, functionally specialized modules (e.g., episodic, semantic, and procedural)—achieve superior generalization and robustness in text game environments. The modularity allows for targeted retrieval, compositional reasoning, and selective updating, which together enable the agent to adapt to novel tasks, recover from errors, and transfer knowledge across games.</p>
