                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Law Abstraction via LLM-Driven Scholarly Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large corpora of scholarly papers, can autonomously abstract qualitative scientific laws by identifying recurring patterns, analogies, and causal structures across diverse texts. The process leverages the LLM's ability to synthesize, generalize, and reconcile conflicting or complementary findings, resulting in emergent, high-level qualitative laws that are not explicitly stated in any single source.</p>
