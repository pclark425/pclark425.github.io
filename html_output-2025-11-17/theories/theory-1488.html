                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1488</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Integration of Modal and Amodal Codes</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge is represented in a hierarchical system, where lower levels encode modal (sensory-motor) features and higher levels encode increasingly abstract, amodal features. Integration across levels allows for both grounded and abstract conceptual processing, with dynamic recruitment of levels depending on task demands.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificial stimulation of intermediate levels will bias conceptual processing toward hybrid representations.</li>
                <li>Machine learning models with hierarchical integration will better match human conceptual flexibility.</li>
                <li>Cross-modal training will enhance integration across hierarchical levels.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If no hierarchical organization is observed in conceptual processing, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If task demands do not modulate recruitment of hierarchical levels, the theory would be undermined.</li>
