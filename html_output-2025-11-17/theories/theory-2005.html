                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Law Abstraction via LLM Semantic Aggregation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill qualitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers by leveraging their ability to semantically aggregate, abstract, and generalize patterns across diverse textual sources. The process is driven by the LLM's capacity to identify recurring conceptual relationships, synthesize them into higher-level abstractions, and express them as conditional qualitative laws, even when explicit formalization is absent in the source material.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>LLMs will be able to generate qualitative laws that closely match those found in scientific reviews or textbooks when given access to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to synthesize novel qualitative laws that have not yet been explicitly stated in the literature, potentially leading to new scientific discoveries.</li>
                <li>LLMs might identify subtle, higher-order relationships that are not apparent to human readers, especially in highly interdisciplinary corpora.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to abstract any meaningful qualitative laws from a corpus known to contain them, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot reconcile conflicting findings and instead produce incoherent or contradictory law statements, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of LLM hallucination or fabrication of spurious laws is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The role of prompt engineering and user guidance in shaping the abstraction process is not explicitly considered. </li>
