                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and detection are governed by dynamic, bidirectional fluxes of molecular biomarkers (such as amyloid-beta, tau, neuroinflammatory mediators, and metabolic byproducts) between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral compartments (blood, CSF, lymphatics). The theory asserts that the rates, directions, and regulatory mechanisms of these fluxes are critical determinants of both disease progression and the reliability of peripheral biomarker-based diagnostics.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Amyloid-beta and tau are detected in both CSF and blood, with evidence of transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and via glymphatic/lymphatic routes. </li>
    <li>Peripheral inflammation can influence CNS biomarker levels and vice versa. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the existence of CNS-peripheral biomarker exchange is established, the theory's emphasis on dynamic fluxes as central to both disease and detection is a new conceptual synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that CNS-derived proteins can be detected in peripheral fluids and that the BBB is semi-permeable to certain molecules.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of AD pathogenesis and detection as a function of dynamic, regulated, bidirectional biomarker fluxes, rather than static concentrations, is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the rate of amyloid-beta flux from CNS to blood is experimentally increased (e.g., by enhancing glymphatic clearance), CNS amyloid burden will decrease and peripheral amyloid-beta levels will transiently rise.</li>

                <li>Acute changes in BBB permeability (e.g., during systemic inflammation) will cause transient shifts in peripheral biomarker levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Modulating peripheral biomarker flux (e.g., by targeting lymphatic drainage) will slow or reverse AD progression in humans.</li>
                <li>Novel, non-traditional biomarkers (e.g., microRNAs or exosomes) with high flux rates will outperform static protein markers for early AD detection.</li>
                <li>Artificially manipulating peripheral biomarker concentrations (e.g., via plasmapheresis) will alter CNS pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If CNS and peripheral biomarker levels are completely uncorrelated in longitudinal studies, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If interventions that alter biomarker flux (e.g., enhancing glymphatic flow) have no effect on CNS pathology or peripheral biomarker levels, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If individuals with impaired peripheral clearance do not show altered AD risk or biomarker profiles, the theory would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where AD pathology progresses despite normal biomarker flux rates, suggesting alternative mechanisms. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
