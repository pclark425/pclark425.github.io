                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1734</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relational Generalization Theory for LLM-Based Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs leverage their ability to generalize contextual and relational patterns within lists and tabular data, enabling them to detect anomalies that violate learned or inferred relationships, even when such relationships are implicit or cross-row/column. The theory further posits that LLMs' anomaly detection is not limited to surface-level statistical outliers, but extends to violations of higher-order, context-dependent rules.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to infer and enforce complex, domain-specific relational rules in highly novel tabular data.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to detect anomalies that violate clear relational dependencies, the theory's core claim is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generalize to new relational patterns in unseen data, the generalization law is called into question.</li>
