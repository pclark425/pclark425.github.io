                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Coordination Theory for LLM Agents: Dynamic Memory Integration Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically integrating multiple forms of memory (contextual, retrieved, and external/tool-based) through a coordination mechanism that adapts to task demands, agent uncertainty, and environmental feedback. The theory asserts that the agent's memory system must flexibly allocate attention and retrieval resources across these memory types, balancing recency, relevance, and reliability to maximize reasoning and decision-making efficacy.</p>
