                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Construction and Hypothesis Testing Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by actively constructing, updating, and testing internal hypotheses about the game world, using memory as a workspace for maintaining and revising these hypotheses. Rather than passively storing all information, the agent selectively encodes observations that are relevant to its current hypotheses, and uses memory to track evidence for or against them. This enables efficient exploration, planning, and adaptation in complex, partially observable environments.</p>
