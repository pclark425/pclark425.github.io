                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Probabilistic Emergence in Retrieval-Augmented LLM Ensembles</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the combination of retrieval-augmented LLMs and ensemble reasoning enables the emergence of probabilistic signals that are not apparent to individual models or human experts. By integrating diverse, contextually relevant information and aggregating multiple reasoning chains, LLMs can surface weak, distributed signals and synthesize them into actionable probability estimates for future scientific discoveries.</p>
