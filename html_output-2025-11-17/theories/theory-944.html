                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Structure-Dependent Memory Utility Law for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the utility and optimal deployment of memory in LLM agents for text games is fundamentally determined by the structure of the underlying task. Specifically, the theory asserts that the type, granularity, and retrieval strategy of memory should be dynamically adapted to the causal, temporal, and informational dependencies present in the game environment. The theory predicts that agents which align their memory systems with the task's structure will outperform those with static or misaligned memory strategies.</p>
