                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1788</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Probabilistic Knowledge Diffusion Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by modeling the diffusion of knowledge through the scientific community as reflected in their training data. The LLM's internal representations capture not only the current state of knowledge but also the rate and direction of knowledge propagation, allowing them to forecast the likelihood of new discoveries based on patterns of citation, adoption, and conceptual recombination.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may identify high-probability discoveries in areas where citation networks are sparse but conceptually rich.</li>
                <li>LLMs may predict discoveries resulting from rare but impactful recombinations that have not yet been attempted.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to forecast the emergence of entirely new fields based on latent patterns of knowledge diffusion.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to assign higher probabilities to discoveries that follow rapid knowledge diffusion, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot identify or assign high probability to impactful conceptual recombinations, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs overpredict discoveries in areas with high citation but little genuine innovation, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Discoveries arising from non-citable, informal, or tacit knowledge exchanges are not captured by citation-based diffusion. </li>
    <li>Breakthroughs in fields with poor citation practices or limited digital records may be missed. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
