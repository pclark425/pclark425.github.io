                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Application-Aligned Molecular Designers via Latent Property Embedding</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when trained on chemical data annotated with properties and application contexts, develop latent embedding spaces that align molecular structure with functional properties and application requirements. These embeddings enable LLMs to synthesize novel chemicals that are not only structurally valid but also optimized for specific applications, by mapping application prompts to regions of chemical space with high likelihood of desired properties.</p>
