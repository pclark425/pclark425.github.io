                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Imbalance and Clearance Failure Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of proteostasis, where the balance between production, aggregation, and clearance of misfolded proteins (amyloid-beta, tau) is disrupted. The failure of clearance mechanisms—especially glymphatic and microglial pathways—leads to toxic accumulation, which triggers downstream neurodegeneration. Detection is most effective by assessing dynamic clearance capacity and proteostatic stress markers.</p>
