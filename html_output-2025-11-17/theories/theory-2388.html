                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Proteostasis Coupling Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the coupling between their baseline and stimulus-driven activity levels and their intrinsic proteostasis (protein homeostasis) capacity. Neurons with high sustained activity and low proteostasis reserve are more susceptible to pathological protein aggregation, while those with lower activity or robust proteostasis mechanisms are resistant.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Highly active neurons accumulate more misfolded proteins and are more vulnerable in models of neurodegeneration. </li>
    <li>Proteostasis capacity (e.g., chaperone expression, autophagy) varies by cell type and correlates with vulnerability. </li>
    <li>In Alzheimer's models, hyperactive neurons in the cortex are more likely to develop amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles. </li>
    <li>Neuronal populations with high synaptic activity show increased metabolic and oxidative stress, which can impair proteostasis. </li>
    <li>Experimental reduction of proteostasis (e.g., via chaperone knockdown) in active neurons accelerates protein aggregation. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While activity and proteostasis have been studied, their conditional interaction as a determinant of vulnerability is not a major focus in existing theories.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Activity-dependent vulnerability and proteostasis impairment have been separately implicated in neurodegeneration.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law explicitly links the interaction between neuronal activity and proteostasis capacity as a conditional determinant of selective vulnerability.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially reducing activity in vulnerable visual cortical populations in vivo will prevent or delay pathology, even in the presence of amyloid-β or tau seeds.</li>
                <li>Proteostasis-enhancing drugs will selectively protect high-activity, low-reserve neurons but not low-activity, high-reserve neurons.</li>
                <li>Chronic visual deprivation (e.g., dark rearing) will reduce vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If visual cortical neurons with high activity and low proteostasis do not develop pathology in amyloid-β/tau models, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing proteostasis capacity does not confer resistance in high-activity neurons, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If neurons with low activity and low proteostasis are equally vulnerable as high-activity, low-proteostasis neurons, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some resistant neuronal populations have moderate activity and moderate proteostasis, suggesting other factors may contribute. </li>
    <li>Regional differences in vascularization or glial support may also influence vulnerability, which is not addressed by this theory. </li>
