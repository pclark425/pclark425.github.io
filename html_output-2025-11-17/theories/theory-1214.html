            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate molecules matching the semantic content of application descriptions, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot integrate multiple contextual constraints into molecule generation, the theory would be falsified.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the interpretability of the mapping between language and chemical structure. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain how LLMs handle ambiguous or conflicting application descriptions. </li>
