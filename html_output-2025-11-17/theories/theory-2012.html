                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Emergence of Universal Reviewer Feedback Laws</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that when large language models (LLMs) are exposed to large corpora of peer review texts across diverse scientific domains, they can distill a set of universal qualitative laws that underlie reviewer feedback. These laws emerge from the statistical and semantic regularities present in the language of peer review, regardless of field, and can be abstracted by LLMs due to their capacity for high-level pattern recognition and generalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While LLM generalization and universal peer review criteria are known, the explicit emergence of qualitative laws via LLM-driven distillation is a new synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs' ability to generalize across domains and the existence of universal peer review criteria are established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The emergence of explicit, abstracted feedback laws from LLM-driven synthesis across domains is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs trained on peer review texts from multiple fields will identify a core set of feedback laws (e.g., clarity, novelty, rigor) that are present in all domains.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to generate domain-agnostic reviewer guidelines that align with human expert consensus.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may uncover latent universal feedback laws not previously formalized by human reviewers.</li>
                <li>Emergent laws may reveal new dimensions of peer review quality or bias not captured in current guidelines.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to extract any common feedback laws from multidomain corpora, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If the laws extracted by LLMs do not align with human-identified universal criteria, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The influence of non-textual peer review signals (e.g., reviewer identity, institutional context) is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes known LLM capabilities and peer review research into a new framework for law emergence.</p>
