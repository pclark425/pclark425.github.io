                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance and Salience-Driven Memory Utilization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by dynamically selecting and retrieving information based on contextual relevance and salience. The agent should employ mechanisms to assess the importance of past events, objects, and facts relative to the current game state, and prioritize memory retrieval and storage accordingly. This selective memory utilization enables efficient reasoning, reduces distraction from irrelevant details, and supports adaptive planning in complex, branching game environments.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>LLM agents with contextual salience filtering and adaptive memory pruning will outperform agents with unfiltered, exhaustive memory on tasks with many distractors.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an agent's salience model is learned end-to-end, it may discover novel, non-obvious relevance patterns that outperform hand-crafted heuristics.</li>
                <li>Adaptive pruning may enable agents to generalize better to unseen, more complex text games by avoiding overfitting to irrelevant details.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with salience-driven memory do not outperform exhaustive-memory agents in distractor-rich environments, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If aggressive pruning leads to loss of critical information and task failure, the theory's assumptions about relevance estimation are called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to recover pruned information if it becomes relevant again due to unexpected game events. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
