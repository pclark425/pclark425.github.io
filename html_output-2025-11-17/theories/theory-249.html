                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Natural language descriptions of computational experiments systematically omit critical implementation details that are necessary for faithful reproduction, creating a faithfulness gap between description and code. This incompleteness arises from three mechanisms: (1) cognitive invisibility - details that are implicit or automatic to the original implementer and thus not consciously documented, (2) assumed context - dependencies on environmental, data, or domain-specific factors that authors assume are 'standard' or 'obvious', and (3) specification cost - the prohibitive effort required to document every implementation decision. The theory predicts that specification incompleteness follows predictable patterns across categories (environmental dependencies, algorithmic details, data assumptions, edge case handling, and implicit parameters), with 60-80% of faithfulness gaps attributable to systematic omissions rather than intentional obfuscation. The degree of incompleteness correlates with implementation complexity and inversely correlates with domain standardization.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Natural language descriptions systematically omit implementation details across five primary categories: (1) environmental dependencies (software versions, hardware, system configurations), (2) algorithmic details (initialization schemes, numerical precision, optimization details), (3) data assumptions (preprocessing, format expectations, missing value handling), (4) stochastic elements (random seeds, sampling procedures), and (5) edge case handling (boundary conditions, error recovery).</li>
                <li>The probability that a specification detail is omitted increases with: (a) the cognitive distance between the detail and the core algorithm (environmental factors > data preprocessing > algorithmic details), (b) the perceived 'standardness' of the detail in the domain, and (c) the effort required to document the detail.</li>
                <li>Specification incompleteness follows a power-law distribution: 20-30% of omitted details account for 70-80% of reproducibility failures, with environmental dependencies and data preprocessing being the most critical categories.</li>
                <li>The degree of specification incompleteness correlates positively with implementation complexity (lines of code, number of dependencies, algorithmic sophistication) and negatively with domain standardization (established protocols, common toolchains).</li>
                <li>Specification incompleteness is largely unintentional: 60-80% of omissions result from cognitive invisibility and assumed context rather than deliberate concealment or competitive advantage.</li>
                <li>Automated specification extraction from code can capture 50-70% of critical details, but the remaining 30-50% require human interpretation of intent, context, and implicit assumptions.</li>
                <li>The faithfulness gap grows over time as environmental drift, dependency evolution, and context loss compound the effects of initial incompleteness.</li>
                <li>Cross-domain or cross-platform reproduction attempts amplify the effects of specification incompleteness by violating assumed context that same-domain implementations preserve.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Software version differences and environmental configurations cause significant reproducibility issues in computational research, yet are frequently omitted from method descriptions. </li>
    <li>Random seed specification and stochastic elements are frequently omitted from descriptions despite having major effects on results. </li>
    <li>Algorithmic details and hyperparameter choices are often incompletely specified in natural language descriptions, requiring reverse-engineering from code. </li>
    <li>Data preprocessing steps and assumptions about data formats are systematically underspecified in method descriptions. </li>
    <li>Edge cases, error handling, and boundary conditions are rarely documented in natural language descriptions but are critical for faithful implementation. </li>
    <li>Containerization and detailed specification tools have emerged to address incompleteness, but adoption remains limited and incomplete. </li>
    <li>Checklists and structured reporting guidelines improve completeness but are not universally adopted or enforced. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Analyzing reproducibility failures will show that 60-80% are attributable to specification incompleteness (omitted details) rather than errors in the provided description or code bugs.</li>
                <li>Providing structured checklists covering the five categories of specification details will reduce incompleteness by 40-60% and improve reproduction success rates proportionally.</li>
                <li>The number of omitted specification details will correlate with code complexity metrics (lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, dependency count) following a log-linear relationship.</li>
                <li>Domains with established standardization (e.g., genomics pipelines with standard file formats) will show 30-50% less specification incompleteness than emerging domains (e.g., novel deep learning architectures).</li>
                <li>Automated code analysis tools that extract environmental dependencies, hyperparameters, and data assumptions will identify 50-70% of critical omissions when compared against complete specifications.</li>
                <li>Time-to-successful-reproduction will correlate strongly with the number of omitted specification details, with each major category of omission adding predictable delays.</li>
                <li>Specification incompleteness will be higher in supplementary materials and code comments than in main text descriptions, but supplementary materials will still contain 40-60% of critical details absent from main text.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether AI-assisted specification extraction can achieve >80% completeness by learning patterns of omission from large corpora of code-description pairs, potentially automating the documentation of implicit details.</li>
                <li>The extent to which complete specifications create brittleness that prevents beneficial adaptation: whether exhaustive documentation of all details inhibits scientific progress by discouraging modification and improvement.</li>
                <li>Whether specification incompleteness serves an unrecognized functional role in scientific communication by allowing flexibility in interpretation and adaptation across contexts.</li>
                <li>The interaction between specification incompleteness and scientific validity: whether methods that are robust to specification variations represent more generalizable science than those requiring exact specification.</li>
                <li>Whether domain-specific languages or formal specification methods can reduce incompleteness to <20% while remaining practical for researchers to use.</li>
                <li>The degree to which specification incompleteness reflects genuine ambiguity in the original implementation (where the implementer made arbitrary choices) versus documentable but omitted details.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that providing complete specifications across all five categories does not improve reproduction success rates would challenge the causal role of specification incompleteness in faithfulness gaps.</li>
                <li>Showing that specification incompleteness is uniformly distributed across categories rather than concentrated in environmental and data preprocessing would challenge the power-law prediction.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that specification incompleteness does not correlate with implementation complexity would challenge the complexity-incompleteness relationship.</li>
                <li>Evidence that most omissions are intentional rather than due to cognitive invisibility would challenge the unintentional-omission mechanism.</li>
                <li>Finding that automated specification extraction achieves >90% completeness without human interpretation would challenge the necessity of human involvement in specification.</li>
                <li>Showing that same-domain and cross-domain reproduction attempts have equal failure rates would challenge the assumed-context mechanism.</li>
                <li>Evidence that specification incompleteness does not grow over time would challenge the temporal-drift prediction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of tacit knowledge and embodied expertise that may be fundamentally difficult to articulate in either natural language or code comments. </li>
    <li>Intentional strategic omissions for competitive advantage, intellectual property protection, or to maintain research advantages. </li>
    <li>The interaction between specification incompleteness and code readability: whether more complete specifications in natural language reduce the need for readable code or vice versa. </li>
    <li>Cultural and disciplinary differences in what is considered 'obvious' or 'standard', leading to variable incompleteness across research communities. </li>
    <li>The role of interactive and exploratory development processes where implementers themselves may not have complete specifications until after implementation. </li>
