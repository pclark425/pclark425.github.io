                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Goal-Driven Memory Prioritization in LLM Agents for Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by prioritizing memory storage and retrieval based on the agent's current and anticipated goals. Rather than treating all information equally, the agent dynamically allocates memory resources to facts, events, and entities most relevant to its objectives, enabling efficient use of limited memory and improved task completion.</p>
