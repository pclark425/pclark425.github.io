                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Voronoi-Intersection Decision Point Superiority Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about navigation complexity in text worlds that relates graph-topology features (diameter, clustering, dead-ends, door constraints) to exploration efficiency and optimal policy structure, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In continuous spatial navigation environments, decision points placed at Voronoi diagram intersections (medial axis intersections) are superior to frontier-based or arbitrary waypoints for mid-term planning. This superiority arises from four key properties: (1) intersection points maximize distance from obstacles, reducing collision risk and improving collision avoidance (SCA); (2) they provide broader perceptual coverage due to central positioning in free space, increasing explored area per path length (SEA); (3) they naturally correspond to topologically significant locations (junctions, room centers, corridor intersections) that are natural decision points; and (4) they provide adaptive granularity that scales with environment complexity. Policies that select waypoints at Voronoi intersections achieve higher success rates (42% vs lower for frontier methods on HM3D), better collision avoidance (higher SCA), and superior exploration efficiency (higher SEA) than frontier-based alternatives. The theory applies most strongly when combined with semantic reasoning (e.g., LLM-based goal selection) and when the Voronoi graph is appropriately pruned and sparsified to remove trivial connections.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Waypoints at Voronoi intersections have higher expected perceptual coverage than frontier points due to central positioning in free space, measurable as higher SEA (Success-weighted Explored Area).</li>
                <li>Collision probability decreases monotonically with distance from nearest obstacle, making Voronoi points safer than frontier points, measurable as higher SCA (Success-weighted Collision Avoidance).</li>
                <li>Voronoi intersections correspond to topologically significant locations (junctions, room centers, corridor intersections) that are natural decision points for navigation.</li>
                <li>The density of Voronoi intersections scales appropriately with environment complexity, providing natural adaptive granularity without manual tuning.</li>
                <li>Planning over Voronoi intersection graphs requires fewer nodes than dense grid representations while maintaining path quality (e.g., ~205 nodes vs ~85,000 grid nodes in SemaFORR).</li>
                <li>Voronoi-based waypoint selection enables faster planning than dense grid representations (e.g., 3.56s vs 15s for grid A* in SemaFORR).</li>
                <li>The advantage of Voronoi intersections is enhanced when combined with semantic reasoning (e.g., LLM-based goal selection) and appropriate graph pruning/sparsification.</li>
                <li>Exploratory nodes (single-edge nodes to unexplored areas in RVG) can be flagged to bias exploration toward frontiers while maintaining intersection-based decision structure.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>VoroNav using Voronoi intersections achieves 42% success on HM3D and 41% success on HSSD, with SPL of 26.0 and 23.2 respectively. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.0" class="evidence-link">[e1237.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Voronoi-based methods outperform Frontier-based methods with higher Success, SPL, SCA (collision avoidance), and SEA (explored area per path length). <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.0" class="evidence-link">[e1237.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Frontier-based exploration achieves lower SPL and Success than Voronoi-based methods (Frontier SCA HM3D 24.2 SEA 17.4), with frontier choices being less informative per step and more collision-prone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.3" class="evidence-link">[e1237.3]</a> </li>
    <li>RVG (Reduced Voronoi Graph) nodes at intersections give richer observations and lead to more informative mid-term decisions; using RVG increases SEA and SCA relative to frontier-only planning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.1" class="evidence-link">[e1237.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Selecting intersections (RVG nodes) as decision points increases perceptual coverage per step and reduces proximity to obstacles, improving obstacle-avoidance and observed area per path length. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.0" class="evidence-link">[e1237.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GraphNav with manually-annotated topological maps placing nodes at semantic locations (rooms, doors, corridor orientations) achieves up to 83.3% success (GTL) in real indoor navigation, demonstrating value of topologically significant decision points. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1347.html#e1347.0" class="evidence-link">[e1347.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SemaFORR using passage-focused skeleton (similar to medial axis) achieves 70.6% success vs 46.17% for ablated system without deliberate exploration, with planning time of 3.56s vs ~15s for grid A* and ~60s for model-based A*. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1180.html#e1180.0" class="evidence-link">[e1180.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1180.html#e1180.1" class="evidence-link">[e1180.1]</a> </li>
    <li>RVG provides sparse, skeleton-like connectivity capturing medial-axis routes and intersections; connectivity is pruned to emphasize informative intersections. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.1" class="evidence-link">[e1237.1]</a> </li>
    <li>GVD (Generalized Voronoi Diagram) provides geometric substrate whose intersections/branches correspond to informative vantage points; pruning to RVG improves usability for planning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.2" class="evidence-link">[e1237.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Using medial-axis-derived nodes concentrates planning on central traversable corridors and intersections, reducing proximity to obstacles. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.2" class="evidence-link">[e1237.2]</a> </li>
    <li>VoroNav's hierarchical reward W = P + C + L (exploration + efficiency + semantic) prioritizing exploration then efficiency then semantics reduces backtracking and improves exploration efficiency. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.0" class="evidence-link">[e1237.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a cluttered indoor environment, policies using Voronoi intersections will have >20% higher SCA (collision avoidance) scores than frontier-based policies.</li>
                <li>The number of Voronoi intersections will correlate strongly (r > 0.7) with environment navigational complexity measured by number of rooms and corridor junctions.</li>
                <li>Voronoi-based waypoints will enable faster planning (>2x speedup) than dense grid representations for equivalent path quality in environments with >50 rooms.</li>
                <li>Combining Voronoi intersection selection with semantic LLM-based scoring will achieve >10% higher success rates than pure geometric Voronoi selection alone.</li>
                <li>In environments with narrow passages, supplementing Voronoi intersections with exploratory nodes will maintain high SEA while improving coverage.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In outdoor environments with less structured obstacles and more open space, the advantage of Voronoi intersections may diminish significantly or disappear entirely.</li>
                <li>Very large-scale environments (>200 rooms) may require hierarchical Voronoi representations with multiple levels of abstraction that current single-level theory doesn't address.</li>
                <li>Dynamic environments where obstacles move frequently may require online Voronoi recomputation at rates that could be computationally prohibitive (>1 Hz update rate).</li>
                <li>In 3D environments with multiple floors and vertical connectivity, extending Voronoi diagrams to 3D may introduce computational complexity that outweighs benefits.</li>
                <li>The optimal pruning threshold for Voronoi graphs may vary significantly across environment types in ways not yet characterized.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding indoor environments where frontier-based waypoints consistently achieve higher SCA and SEA than Voronoi intersections would challenge the core claims.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that collision rates are not lower at Voronoi points than at frontier points would contradict a key mechanism.</li>
                <li>Showing that Voronoi intersections do not correspond to topologically significant locations in a substantial fraction of real environments would weaken the theory.</li>
                <li>Finding that the computational cost of Voronoi computation and maintenance exceeds the planning time savings would challenge practical applicability.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that pure geometric Voronoi selection without semantic reasoning performs no better than random waypoint selection would suggest the geometric structure alone is insufficient.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory doesn't specify how to handle 3D environments where Voronoi diagrams become significantly more complex and computationally expensive. </li>
    <li>The computational cost of online Voronoi diagram computation and maintenance is not quantified or bounded in the theory. </li>
    <li>LTvN uses controller-aware reachability rather than pure geometric Voronoi, suggesting that geometric Voronoi structure alone may be insufficient and must be adapted to actual traversability. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1163.html#e1163.0" class="evidence-link">[e1163.0]</a> </li>
    <li>VoroNav's success depends significantly on LLM-based semantic reasoning integrated with geometric Voronoi structure, but the theory doesn't fully account for the relative contributions of geometric vs semantic components. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.0" class="evidence-link">[e1237.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The optimal pruning strategy for Voronoi graphs (merge proximate nodes, remove trivial forks) is mentioned but not formalized in the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1237.html#e1237.1" class="evidence-link">[e1237.1]</a> </li>
    <li>How to handle disconnected Voronoi components or isolated intersections in complex environments is not addressed. </li>

        "In environments with many narrow passages, Voronoi intersections may be too sparse and require supplementation with exploratory nodes or additional waypoints.",
        "For very short-range navigation (&lt; 2 meters), the overhead of Voronoi computation may outweigh benefits and simpler local planning may suffice.",
        "In environments where semantic information (doors, room types) is critical, pure geometric Voronoi must be augmented with semantic reasoning (e.g., LLM-based) to achieve high performance.",
        "The Voronoi graph must be appropriately pruned and sparsified; unpruned Voronoi graphs can have too many nodes and degrade performance.",
        "In dynamic environments with moving obstacles, the Voronoi diagram may need frequent recomputation that could be computationally expensive.",
        "Controller-dependent reachability (as in LTvN) may be necessary to adapt geometric Voronoi structure to actual robot/agent capabilities.",
        "The hierarchical reward structure (exploration + efficiency + semantic) is important for effective waypoint selection, not just geometric position."
