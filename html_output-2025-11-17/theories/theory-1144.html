                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Decomposition and Iterative Composition Law (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) can achieve strict logical reasoning by decomposing complex prompts into atomic subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then iteratively composing the solutions using explicit logical operators. The process is governed by a set of rules that ensure the preservation of logical validity and consistency throughout the decomposition and recomposition steps.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to chain-of-thought and program-aided prompting, this law formalizes the decomposition-composition process as a necessary and sufficient condition for strict logical reasoning in LMs.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Chain-of-thought and stepwise prompting are known to improve LM reasoning by encouraging intermediate steps.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formalization of decomposition and iterative composition as a law governing strict logical reasoning, with a focus on atomicity and logical operator-based recomposition, is novel.</p>
