                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1536</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Inequality Confinement via Macroscopic Quantum Coherence Networks</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory proposes that networks of coherently coupled quantum systems (such as superconducting circuits, Bose-Einstein condensates, or photonic lattices) can be engineered to collectively generate, stabilize, and confine negative energy densities on macroscopic scales. By synchronizing quantum coherence across large arrays, the negative energy contributions of individual elements can be constructively combined, potentially overcoming the limitations imposed by quantum inequalities and enabling the practical realization of FTL-supporting spacetime geometries.</p>
