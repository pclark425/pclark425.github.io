                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can distill quantitative laws from scholarly literature by semantically abstracting and unifying variables and relationships across papers, even when these are expressed with different nomenclature, units, or contextual framing. The LLM's deep contextual understanding enables it to recognize equivalence and synthesize generalized laws from heterogeneous sources.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover new, generalized laws that span multiple scientific domains previously thought unrelated.</li>
                <li>LLMs may propose unifying frameworks for disparate quantitative relationships.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may struggle with highly ambiguous or polysemous variables. </li>
    <li>Domain-specific jargon or notation may impede variable unification. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
