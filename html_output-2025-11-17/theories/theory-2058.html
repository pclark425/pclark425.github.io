                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Empirical Rule Synthesis and Feature Abstraction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large corpora of scholarly literature, can autonomously synthesize empirical rules and abstract salient features by identifying recurring patterns, relationships, and mathematical forms across diverse scientific texts. The LLM's ability to generalize, compress, and represent knowledge enables it to distill both qualitative and quantitative laws, even in the presence of noisy, heterogeneous, or incomplete data.</p>

                <li>LLMs could synthesize cross-domain abstractions that unify disparate scientific phenomena.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to extract known empirical laws from large corpora, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot abstract common features from diverse representations, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs produce only superficial or spurious rules, the theory's claims about meaningful synthesis would be questioned.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain LLM limitations in highly technical or data-scarce domains. </li>
    <li>The impact of training data quality and bias on rule synthesis is not addressed. </li>
