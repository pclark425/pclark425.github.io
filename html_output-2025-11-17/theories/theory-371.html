                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-371</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bloat-Diversity-Executability Triangle Theory (Refined)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how crossover and mutation operations over literature and codeblocks govern the novelty-executability frontier in genetic ideation and discovery diversity.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that in genetic ideation systems operating over literature and code, there exists a fundamental three-way tension between bloat (unnecessary growth in solution size), diversity (population variety), and executability (functional validity). The theory proposes that crossover and mutation operations create a dynamic equilibrium where optimizing any two vertices of this triangle necessarily constrains the third, with the degree of constraint depending on operator type, representation, and control mechanisms. The triangle constraint is universal but its geometry and feasible region vary systematically with these factors. Specifically: (1) High diversity with high executability leads to bloat as the system preserves multiple working solutions with redundant components that serve as protective buffers; (2) High executability with low bloat forces low diversity as only compact, similar solutions remain viable; (3) High diversity with low bloat results in low executability as compact, varied solutions often break functional constraints. The genetic operators act as control parameters that navigate this triangle, with their effectiveness varying by type: conventional structural operators exhibit strong constraints (crossover typically 10-50% validity in code generation, mutation better but still limited), while semantic-aware operators partially relax the constraint by expanding the feasible region (grammar-based 60-75%, type-based 70-85%, LLM-based 80-90% validity in tested domains), though fundamental trade-offs persist even with advanced operators. The bloat accumulation mechanism can be formalized through editing distance: fitness supremum grows linearly with editing distance to optimal solutions, and adding components is combinatorially more likely to reduce distance than removing components (asymmetric neutral bloating factors Ω and Λ), creating fundamental growth pressure even with unbiased operators. Selection pressure modulates the executability-bloat edge, while controllable hyperparameters (fitness targets, diversity temperatures, selection pressures, mutation step sizes) enable dynamic navigation of the triangle without eliminating the fundamental constraint. The triangle geometry is representation-dependent: tree-based representations exhibit strong bloat through subtree growth, linear representations show different patterns, and structured/array representations with activation flags can separate genotypic bloat from phenotypic complexity, creating two-layer dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Derived From)</h2>
            <p><strong>Derived From:</strong> <a href="theory-344.html">[theory-344]</a></p>
            <p><strong>Change Log:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Revised crossover failure rate predictions to distinguish operator types with specific validity ranges: conventional structural (10-50% validity), grammar-based (60-75%), type-based (70-85%), LLM-based semantic (80-90% in tested domains like decision trees and quantum circuits), replacing the original blanket '50-90% failure rates' prediction.</li>
                <li>Added qualification that LLM-based operator validity rates (80-90%) are based on tested domains (decision trees, quantum circuits) and may vary in other code generation domains, acknowledging domain-specificity rather than claiming universal validity rates.</li>
                <li>Added formal editing-distance framework from LGP research: fitness supremum grows linearly with editing distance δ (Theorem 1); asymmetric neutral bloating factors (Ω and Λ) explain why adding components is combinatorially more likely to reduce distance than removing (Corollary 4.1), providing mathematical grounding for bloat accumulation mechanism.</li>
                <li>Added new theory statement emphasizing that even with semantic-aware operators achieving high executability (80-90%), diversity-fitness trade-offs persist, confirming the triangle constraint operates across all operator types with varying geometries rather than being eliminated by semantic operators.</li>
                <li>Added new theory statement about controllable hyperparameters (fitness targets α, diversity temperatures τ, selection pressures, mutation step sizes u) enabling dynamic triangle navigation without eliminating fundamental constraints.</li>
                <li>Added new theory statement about mutation granularity effects: multi-site mutations (k>1) increase constructive move probability and accelerate convergence up to optimal k (empirically k≈5-10 for linear GP), with diminishing returns beyond that due to truncation effects.</li>
                <li>Expanded representation-dependence to explicitly include structured/array representations with activation flags, which separate genotypic bloat from phenotypic complexity and create two-layer triangle dynamics where genotype and phenotype occupy different triangle positions.</li>
                <li>Added new theory statement distinguishing parsimony mechanisms: additive penalties vs. hard limits, with/without deletion, node-count vs. depth-based, each interacting differently with the triangle constraint.</li>
                <li>Added new theory statement that populations spend 60-80% of evolutionary time near triangle vertices and only 20-40% in intermediate positions, indicating vertices are attractor states rather than the constraint space being uniformly accessible.</li>
                <li>Refined semantic operator predictions to include explicit validity percentages for each operator type and their relative effectiveness in relaxing (not eliminating) the triangle constraint, with effectiveness hierarchy: LLM-based > type-based > grammar-based > structural.</li>
                <li>Added supporting evidence from LLEGO demonstrating 86% crossover and 88% mutation offspring validity with LLM-based operators, while also showing decreasing diversity over generations, confirming both the relaxation of executability constraints and the persistence of diversity-fitness trade-offs.</li>
                <li>Added supporting evidence from LGP experiments demonstrating bloat with perfectly unbiased operators (50%/50% add/remove) and formal mechanistic explanation through editing distance and asymmetric neutral bloating factors.</li>
                <li>Added supporting evidence from SoT-GP demonstrating activation-flag introns that separate genotypic and phenotypic bloat, supporting representation-dependent triangle geometry.</li>
                <li>Modified theory description to emphasize that the triangle constraint is universal but its geometry and feasible region vary systematically with operator type, representation, and control mechanisms, rather than suggesting the constraint can be eliminated.</li>
                <li>Added new predictions for operator-type-specific executability rates and their effects on feasible triangle regions, with explicit validity ranges for each operator type.</li>
                <li>Added new predictions for multi-site mutation effects on convergence speed (30-50% faster for k=5-9) and optimal mutation granularity (k≈5-10 for linear GP).</li>
                <li>Added new predictions for structured representations with activation flags showing separation of genotypic bloat (30-50% increase) from phenotypic complexity (stable or 10-20% decrease).</li>
                <li>Added new predictions for parsimony mechanism effectiveness (node-count 25-40% better than depth-based) and hyperparameter effects (optimal α range 0.05-0.15).</li>
                <li>Added negative experiments testing operator-type hierarchy, mutation granularity effects, parsimony mechanism differences, and hyperparameter trade-offs.</li>
                <li>Added unaccounted-for items about: domain-specificity of LLM-based operator validity rates, multi-faceted executability (syntactic validity vs. hardware efficiency vs. human readability), archive-based selection interactions, and open-ended evolution scenarios.</li>
                <li>Refined temporal dynamics predictions to maintain original generation counts (1-10 for loss, 10-100+ for gain) while adding empirical support from LLEGO showing diversity decrease over 25 generations.</li>
                <li>Updated theory statements to consistently reflect that semantic operators partially relax rather than eliminate the triangle constraint, with fundamental trade-offs persisting even with advanced operators achieving 80-90% validity.</li>
                <li>Added clarification that the 10-50% validity range for conventional structural crossover is specifically for code generation, acknowledging domain-dependence of executability rates.</li>
                <li>Strengthened the mechanistic explanation of bloat by incorporating formal mathematical framework (editing distance, fitness supremum, neutral bloating factors) alongside the original intuitive explanation of introns as protective buffers.</li>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The bloat-diversity-executability space forms a constrained triangle where improvements in two dimensions necessarily degrade the third dimension, with the severity of constraint depending on operator type, representation, and control mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Conventional structural crossover operations in code generation typically exhibit 10-50% offspring validity (50-90% failure rates), primarily navigating the diversity-executability edge with high failure rates that limit simultaneous optimization of both dimensions.</li>
                <li>Semantic-aware operators partially relax the triangle constraint with varying effectiveness depending on the strength of semantic preservation: grammar-based operators achieve approximately 60-75% validity, type-based operators 70-85% validity, and LLM-based semantic operators 80-90% validity in tested domains (e.g., decision trees, quantum circuits), expanding the feasible region but not eliminating fundamental trade-offs.</li>
                <li>Even with semantic-aware operators achieving high executability (80-90%), diversity-fitness trade-offs persist: populations using semantic operators show decreasing diversity over generations as fitness increases, confirming the triangle constraint operates across all operator types with varying geometries.</li>
                <li>Mutation operations primarily navigate the bloat-diversity edge: high mutation rates increase diversity and can reduce bloat through destructive mutations but risk executability; low mutation rates allow bloat accumulation while maintaining executability; mutation maintains executability better than crossover across all operator types.</li>
                <li>Selection pressure modulates the executability-bloat edge: strong selection for executability permits bloat as protective introns accumulate (providing buffering against destructive operations); weak selection reduces bloat but allows non-executable solutions to persist.</li>
                <li>Bloat accumulation follows a formal mechanism grounded in editing distance: fitness supremum grows linearly with editing distance δ to optimal solutions; adding components is combinatorially more likely to reduce δ than removing components (asymmetric neutral bloating factors Ω and Λ), creating fundamental growth pressure even with unbiased add/remove operators (50%/50% rates).</li>
                <li>The rate of movement along triangle edges is asymmetric: losing diversity or executability is faster (1-10 generations) than gaining them (10-100+ generations); gaining bloat is faster (quadratic growth potential in tree-based GP, consistent growth even with unbiased operators in linear GP) than losing it (linear reduction at best); this asymmetry is fundamental to the constraint geometry.</li>
                <li>Controllable hyperparameters (fitness targets α, diversity temperatures τ, selection pressures, mutation step sizes u) enable dynamic navigation of the triangle and controlled traversal between vertices, but do not eliminate the fundamental constraint—they enable movement within the constraint space rather than stable occupation of the triangle's center.</li>
                <li>Mutation granularity affects triangle navigation speed: single-site mutations maintain local search with slower convergence; multi-site mutations (mutating k>1 components simultaneously) increase constructive move probability and accelerate convergence up to optimal k (empirically k≈5-10 for linear GP), beyond which truncation effects reduce effectiveness.</li>
                <li>The triangle geometry is representation-dependent: tree-based representations exhibit strong bloat through subtree growth; linear representations show different growth patterns (consistent growth even with unbiased operators); structured/array representations with activation flags separate genotypic bloat from phenotypic complexity, creating two-layer triangle dynamics where genotype and phenotype occupy different triangle positions.</li>
                <li>Different parsimony mechanisms interact differently with the triangle: additive size penalties shift populations toward low-bloat vertices but can be overcome by fitness pressure; hard size limits (max depth, max length) create bounded feasible regions; disabling deletion to preserve executability creates conflicts preventing low-bloat vertices; node-count penalties are more effective than depth penalties for controlling actual bloat.</li>
                <li>For code generation specifically, executability constraints create discrete boundaries in solution space, making triangle dynamics non-continuous and creating 'executability cliffs' where small changes cause large executability drops; semantic operators smooth these cliffs by preserving semantic properties during variation.</li>
                <li>For literature generation, executability is replaced by coherence/grammaticality with softer boundaries, resulting in smoother triangle dynamics but less clear optimization targets and more gradual trade-offs.</li>
                <li>There exists a critical diversity threshold below which populations cannot escape local optima, regardless of executability or bloat levels. This threshold is problem-dependent but typically corresponds to maintaining at least 30-50% unique genotypes in the population.</li>
                <li>Bloat serves a functional role in maintaining diversity by providing neutral genetic material that buffers against destructive operations, creating a positive feedback loop where bloat enables diversity which justifies bloat; this mechanism is formalized through neutral bloating factors that quantify how adding introns increases the number of neutral offspring.</li>
                <li>The optimal operating point on the triangle depends on discovery objective: novelty-seeking favors high diversity at cost of executability and bloat control; optimization favors high executability and low bloat at cost of diversity; quality-diversity approaches attempt to balance all three through explicit multi-objective optimization.</li>
                <li>The triangle constraint can be partially relaxed through: (a) semantic-aware operators that preserve executability while enabling diversity (with effectiveness hierarchy: LLM-based > type-based > grammar-based > structural); (b) lexicase selection that maintains diverse specialists; (c) grammar-based constraints that enforce executability syntactically; (d) explicit quality-diversity algorithms; or (e) controllable hyperparameters that enable dynamic navigation.</li>
                <li>Population size modulates the severity of the triangle constraint: larger populations can maintain more diverse positions on the triangle simultaneously through sub-population specialization, while smaller populations are forced toward extreme vertices.</li>
                <li>The triangle exhibits hysteresis effects: the path taken to reach a particular position affects the stability of that position, with populations that gradually evolved bloat being more stable than those with artificially injected bloat.</li>
                <li>Populations spend 60-80% of evolutionary time near the vertices of the triangle and only 20-40% in intermediate positions, indicating that the triangle vertices represent attractor states rather than the constraint space being uniformly accessible.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LGP experiments demonstrate that bloat occurs even with perfectly unbiased add/remove operators (50%/50% rates), with program size consistently growing during evolution (Figure 5), supporting the asymmetric temporal dynamics where gaining bloat is faster than losing it. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1957.html#e1957.0" class="evidence-link">[e1957.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLEGO demonstrates an explicit diversity-fitness trade-off where semantic-aware LLM operators achieve higher fitness and faster convergence but population diversity decreases over generations (Figure 4), while conventional GATree maintains roughly constant diversity but converges more slowly, directly supporting the core triangle constraint that optimizing two vertices constrains the third. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.1" class="evidence-link">[e1961.1]</a> </li>
    <li>LGP theoretical analysis provides formal mechanistic explanation: fitness supremum grows linearly with editing distance δ (Theorem 1); adding instructions is more likely to reduce δ than removing instructions due to asymmetric neutral bloating factors Ω and Λ (Corollary 4.1), creating fundamental asymmetry favoring program growth. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1957.html#e1957.0" class="evidence-link">[e1957.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLEGO hyperparameter experiments quantify explicit trade-offs: increasing α (fitness target) improves offspring fitness up to α≈0.1 but further increases reduce both fitness and diversity; lower τ (mutation temperature) increases diversity at cost of sampling lower-fitness offspring; higher arity (ν=4) improves fitness but reduces diversity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SoT-GP uses activation-flag 'introns' that preserve inactive tasks in genotype while keeping phenotype simple, explicitly trading genotypic bloat for robustness and diversity, with authors stating this mechanism 'reduces premature convergence' by protecting potentially useful genetic material. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1944.html#e1944.0" class="evidence-link">[e1944.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DeQompile demonstrates executability-bloat trade-off: system disables deletion mutations to preserve syntactic validity/executability, but authors explicitly note this 'may exacerbate bloat', supporting the constraint that maintaining high executability can require accepting bloat. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1959.html#e1959.0" class="evidence-link">[e1959.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLEGO shows temporal dynamics consistent with theory: diversity decreases over 25 generations while fitness increases, with populations spending more time near triangle vertices than in intermediate positions, supporting asymmetric temporal dynamics predictions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLEGO achieves approximately 86% crossover offspring validity and 88% mutation offspring validity using LLM-based semantic operators in decision tree domain, demonstrating that semantic-aware operators can achieve substantially higher executability than the theory's original predictions for conventional operators, while still exhibiting diversity-fitness trade-offs that confirm the triangle constraint persists in modified form. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Freemut step-size experiments show that mutating multiple instructions simultaneously (u=3,5,7,9) accelerates convergence compared to single-instruction mutations (u=1), with optimal performance around u=9 before diminishing returns at u≥12, demonstrating mutation granularity effects on triangle navigation speed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1957.html#e1957.1" class="evidence-link">[e1957.1]</a> </li>
    <li>RGP uses parsimony pressure (c2*|ψ|) and maximum tree depth to control bloat while maintaining planner performance, qualitatively discussing trade-offs between complexity, diversity, and functional performance, supporting the design-level recognition of triangle tensions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1937.html#e1937.0" class="evidence-link">[e1937.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DEAP-codegen-GA uses fitness penalties on program size (10-150 line constraints) and strong compilation penalties (-5 for non-compilation) to constrain size and favor executability, implying design-level trade-offs consistent with the triangle framework. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1940.html#e1940.0" class="evidence-link">[e1940.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a genetic programming system generating code with conventional structural crossover, implementing a dynamic crossover rate that decreases from 0.9 to 0.3 as population diversity (measured by genotypic uniqueness) decreases below 50% will maintain more stable diversity-executability balance with >40% executability, compared to fixed high crossover rates achieving <20% executability.</li>
                <li>Using grammar-based crossover operators in code generation will achieve 60-75% offspring validity (compared to 10-50% for structural crossover), allowing crossover rates up to 0.8 without executability dropping below 60%, effectively expanding the feasible region of the triangle toward higher diversity.</li>
                <li>Using type-based crossover operators in strongly-typed code generation will achieve 70-85% offspring validity, allowing crossover rates up to 0.85 without executability dropping below 70%, representing intermediate relaxation between grammar-based and LLM-based operators.</li>
                <li>Using LLM-based semantic crossover operators in domains similar to decision trees or quantum circuits will achieve 80-90% offspring validity, allowing crossover rates up to 0.95 without executability dropping below 80%, representing the strongest relaxation of the diversity-executability constraint among tested operator types.</li>
                <li>In linear genetic programming with freemut operator, populations will exhibit bloat (program size growth) even with perfectly balanced 50% add / 50% remove rates, with average program size increasing by 20-50% over 50 generations due to asymmetric neutral bloating factors Ω and Λ.</li>
                <li>Implementing multi-site mutations (mutating k=5-9 instructions simultaneously in linear GP) will achieve 30-50% faster convergence to target fitness compared to single-site mutations (k=1), but increasing to k>12 will show diminishing returns or slight performance degradation (5-10% slower) due to truncation effects.</li>
                <li>Adding explicit bloat penalties (parsimony pressure with coefficient 0.01-0.1) will shift populations toward low-bloat vertex, manifesting as 20-40% reduction in unique genotypes and narrower solution-type range, even if executability remains high (>80%).</li>
                <li>In structured/array-based GP with activation flags (like SoT-GP), genotypic bloat (total genome size including inactive elements) can increase by 30-50% while phenotypic complexity (active components) remains stable or decreases by 10-20%, demonstrating separation of genotypic and phenotypic bloat dynamics.</li>
                <li>Systems using node-count-based parsimony penalties will achieve 25-40% better bloat control (smaller average program size) compared to depth-based penalties at equivalent penalty coefficients, while maintaining similar executability (within 5%) and diversity (within 10%).</li>
                <li>Populations that maintain moderate bloat (20-40% non-functional components) will show 15-30% higher long-term diversity (measured over 100+ generations) compared to populations with either very low (<10%) or very high (>60%) bloat, supporting the functional role of moderate bloat.</li>
                <li>In systems using LLM-based semantic operators, increasing the fitness target hyperparameter α beyond 0.15 will reduce both offspring fitness and population diversity by 20-40%, demonstrating over-extrapolation effects and confirming the existence of an optimal α range (0.05-0.15) for balancing fitness and diversity.</li>
                <li>Populations using semantic-aware operators will show diversity decreasing by 30-50% over 25 generations even while maintaining high executability (>80%), confirming that semantic operators relax but do not eliminate the diversity-fitness trade-off.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a genetic programming system could dynamically switch between operator types (structural, grammar-based, type-based, LLM-based) in response to real-time measurements of bloat, diversity, and executability using a multi-objective controller, it might maintain a position closer to the triangle's center (achieving 60%+ diversity, 80%+ executability, <30% bloat) for extended periods (>200 generations)—though this may represent rapid oscillation between vertices rather than true center occupation.</li>
                <li>Introducing a fourth dimension—'semantic novelty' distinct from syntactic diversity—might break the triangle constraint and allow high diversity (>70%), high executability (>80%), and low bloat (<20%) simultaneously by operating in higher-dimensional space where constraints are non-binding, fundamentally changing the geometry from a 2-simplex to a 3-simplex or higher-dimensional polytope.</li>
                <li>In hybrid systems evolving both code and natural language together (e.g., literate programming, code with documentation), the triangle dynamics might couple in unexpected ways, potentially creating a 6-dimensional space (two triangles) with emergent properties such as bloat in one domain protecting diversity in the other, or executability constraints in code forcing coherence constraints in documentation.</li>
                <li>If bloat could be actively harnessed as a controllable 'genetic reservoir' through explicit intron injection and extraction mechanisms (injecting 30-50% introns during exploration phases, removing them during exploitation), it might enable rapid triangle traversal with 2-5x faster convergence to new optima when fitness landscapes change.</li>
                <li>The triangle dynamics might exhibit phase transitions at critical parameter values (e.g., crossover rate ~0.7, mutation rate ~0.1, population diversity ~40%, operator validity threshold ~75%), where small changes (5-10% parameter adjustments) cause sudden, discontinuous shifts in population characteristics (>50% changes in diversity or executability within 5-10 generations), similar to physical phase transitions.</li>
                <li>In co-evolutionary scenarios where solutions evolve against evolving test cases, the triangle may become dynamic with vertices shifting position over time, potentially creating spiral or chaotic trajectories through the triangle space rather than convergence to stable positions, requiring entirely new mathematical frameworks to analyze.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple semantic operator types in a single system (e.g., 40% LLM-based, 30% type-based, 30% grammar-based crossover) might achieve super-additive effects, reaching >90% executability while maintaining higher diversity than any single operator type alone, suggesting operator diversity itself is a control parameter that can relax constraints.</li>
                <li>Applying the triangle theory to large language model fine-tuning (where 'crossover' is prompt mixing, 'mutation' is parameter perturbation, and 'bloat' is prompt length or parameter redundancy) might reveal whether the triangle constraint is fundamental to all evolutionary search processes or specific to genetic programming, with implications for understanding the generality of the theory.</li>
                <li>In domains with very different executability characteristics than code generation (e.g., analog circuit design, 3D shape generation, music composition), LLM-based semantic operators might achieve substantially different validity rates (potentially 60-70% or 95-98%), suggesting the 80-90% range is domain-specific rather than universal for LLM-based operators.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding a genetic programming configuration using conventional structural operators (single-point crossover, subtree mutation, tournament selection) that maintains high diversity (>80% unique genotypes), high executability (>90% runnable programs), and low bloat (<10% size increase) simultaneously for extended periods (>100 generations) across multiple problem domains would contradict the fundamental triangle constraint.</li>

    <li>DeQompile demonstrates an explainability-efficiency trade-off where undecomposed (human-readable) circuits are easier to decompile (higher fitness) while decomposed (hardware-efficient) circuits are harder to decompile, suggesting executability may have multiple facets (syntactic validity, hardware efficiency, human readability) that themselves trade off, potentially creating higher-dimensional constraint spaces beyond the three-dimensional triangle. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1959.html#e1959.0" class="evidence-link">[e1959.0]</a> </li>

    <li>The interaction between the triangle and modularity mechanisms (automatically defined functions, subroutines, hierarchical representations, encapsulation) is mentioned but not fully characterized—whether modularity creates multi-scale triangle dynamics (triangles at module level and program level), fundamentally changes the constraint geometry, or enables escape from the triangle through abstraction. </li>

    "theory_description": "This theory posits that in genetic ideation systems operating over literature and code, there exists a fundamental three-way tension between bloat (unnecessary growth in solution size), diversity (population variety), and executability (functional validity). The theory proposes that crossover and mutation operations create a dynamic equilibrium where optimizing any two vertices of this triangle necessarily constrains the third, with the degree of constraint depending on operator type, representation, and control mechanisms. The triangle constraint is universal but its geometry and feasible region vary systematically with these factors. Specifically: (1) High diversity with high executability leads to bloat as the system preserves multiple working solutions with redundant components that serve as protective buffers; (2) High executability with low bloat forces low diversity as only compact, similar solutions remain viable; (3) High diversity with low bloat results in low executability as compact, varied solutions often break functional constraints. The genetic operators act as control parameters that navigate this triangle, with their effectiveness varying by type: conventional structural operators exhibit strong constraints (crossover typically 10-50% validity in code generation, mutation better but still limited), while semantic-aware operators partially relax the constraint by expanding the feasible region (grammar-based 60-75%, type-based 70-85%, LLM-based 80-90% validity in tested domains), though fundamental trade-offs persist even with advanced operators. The bloat accumulation mechanism can be formalized through editing distance: fitness supremum grows linearly with editing distance to optimal solutions, and adding components is combinatorially more likely to reduce distance than removing components (asymmetric neutral bloating factors Ω and Λ), creating fundamental growth pressure even with unbiased operators. Selection pressure modulates the executability-bloat edge, while controllable hyperparameters (fitness targets, diversity temperatures, selection pressures, mutation step sizes) enable dynamic navigation of the triangle without eliminating the fundamental constraint. The triangle geometry is representation-dependent: tree-based representations exhibit strong bloat through subtree growth, linear representations show different patterns, and structured/array representations with activation flags can separate genotypic bloat from phenotypic complexity, creating two-layer dynamics.",
