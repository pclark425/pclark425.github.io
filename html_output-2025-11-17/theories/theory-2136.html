                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be used to distill scientific theories by leveraging explicit and implicit constraints derived from the literature, user queries, and domain ontologies. By encoding and enforcing these constraints during hypothesis generation and synthesis, LLMs can produce theory statements that are both novel and consistent with existing evidence, reducing hallucination and increasing scientific validity.</p>
