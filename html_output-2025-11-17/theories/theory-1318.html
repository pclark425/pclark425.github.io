                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as Emergent Meta-Optimization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when engaged in generate-then-reflect cycles, perform an emergent form of meta-optimization. Through self-reflection, the model identifies and corrects its own errors, biases, or gaps in reasoning, effectively simulating a higher-level optimization process that is not explicitly encoded in its weights. This process leverages the model's internal representations and learned heuristics to iteratively refine outputs, resulting in improved answer quality over multiple iterations.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that models using self-reflection can identify and correct their own mistakes more frequently than single-pass generation. </li>
    <li>Reflection prompts often lead to explicit error analysis and correction in model outputs. </li>
    <li>Madaan et al. (2023) demonstrate that iterative self-reflection improves factual accuracy and reasoning in LLMs. </li>
    <li>Wei et al. (2022) show that chain-of-thought and multi-step reasoning elicit more accurate answers, suggesting that intermediate reflection steps are beneficial. </li>
    <li>Zelikman et al. (2022) show that bootstrapping reasoning with reasoning (i.e., self-improvement) leads to better performance. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on self-reflection and chain-of-thought prompting, the explicit framing as emergent meta-optimization is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that chain-of-thought and self-consistency improve model performance, and that reflection can help identify errors.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law frames the process as an emergent meta-optimization, not just error correction, and formalizes the increase in error identification probability as a function of reflection.</p>
