                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Enabled Iterative Symbolic Law Discovery via Program Synthesis and Simulation Feedback (General Framework)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when combined with program synthesis and simulation feedback, can iteratively distill symbolic, quantitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers. The process involves LLMs extracting candidate symbolic relationships, encoding them as executable programs, and refining these laws through cycles of simulation and feedback, ultimately converging on robust, generalizable scientific laws.</p>
