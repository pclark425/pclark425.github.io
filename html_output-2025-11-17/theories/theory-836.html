                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Memory Utilization Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically modulating the retrieval, storage, and abstraction of memory traces based on task demands, context, and uncertainty. The agent's memory system should not be static or uniform, but should adaptively prioritize, compress, and generalize information to maximize utility for current and future reasoning.</p>
