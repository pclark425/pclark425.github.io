                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Modulation Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically modulating the encoding, retrieval, and consolidation of memories based on real-time assessments of task uncertainty, novelty, and relevance. The agent uses meta-cognitive signals to adjust memory operations, such as prioritizing salient information, compressing redundant data, and selectively forgetting irrelevant details, thereby maximizing efficiency and adaptability across diverse tasks.</p>
