                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative World-State Refinement via Autoregressive Decoding</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that autoregressive language models solve spatial board games by iteratively refining an internal world-state representation at each decoding step, using prior outputs and context to update their beliefs about the board. The model's next token prediction is thus a function of both the explicit input and the evolving latent state, enabling multi-step logical inference and constraint satisfaction.</p>
