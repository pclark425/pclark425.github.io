                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional Proxy-to-Ground-Truth Gap Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about the evaluation and validation of incremental versus transformational scientific discoveries in automated systems.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the divergence between proxy metrics (used by automated evaluation systems) and ground truth scientific value follows systematic patterns based on multiple dimensions of transformation, with different functional forms depending on proxy type and context. Proxy metrics are calibrated on historical data that predominantly reflects incremental science, creating 'training distribution bias' that causes automated systems to systematically undervalue transformational work. The gap magnitude G is context-dependent and follows different mathematical relationships: hyperbolic for displacement-based measures (G ≈ d/(1+b) where d is local displacement and b is knowledge burden), power-law for self-citation effects (penalty ∝ (SCR-β)^γ), and threshold/interaction effects for temporal windows. Transformation is characterized by at least three dimensions: (1) displacement vs consolidation, (2) theoretical vs methodological vs empirical contributions, and (3) conceptual vs interdisciplinary vs technical novelty. Gap magnitudes range from minimal (<20%) for within-domain well-calibrated proxies to very large (>60%) for multiple compounding failures. The theory predicts that proxies based on citation patterns, journal prestige, author reputation, and methodological familiarity will show increasing divergence from ground truth as discoveries become more transformational, with magnitude critically dependent on proxy type, field characteristics (paradigm rigidity β), temporal window length, and data quality. The gap represents systematic bias that can be characterized and corrected through multiple complementary approaches including structured retrieval, relative density normalization, field-specific calibration, hybrid human-AI workflows, topological methods, and portfolio strategies. Ground truth itself is recognized as uncertain and requiring multiple complementary measures.</p>

            <p><strong>Change Log:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Revised functional form from single exponential G(T) ≈ k*e^(βT) to family of context-dependent relationships: hyperbolic G ≈ d/(1+b) for displacement, power-law (SCR-β)^γ for self-citation, threshold/interaction effects for temporal windows</li>
                <li>Expanded transformation from single parameter T to multidimensional framework with three dimensions: (1) displacement vs consolidation, (2) theoretical vs methodological vs empirical, (3) conceptual vs interdisciplinary vs technical novelty</li>
                <li>Revised gap magnitude predictions from uniform 70-90% for highly transformational work to context-dependent ranges: <20% (within-domain calibrated), 20-40% (cross-domain/uncalibrated), 40-60% (short-window/prestige-based), >60% (multiple compounding failures)</li>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The proxy-to-ground-truth gap G follows different mathematical relationships depending on proxy type: hyperbolic for displacement-based measures (G ≈ d/(1+b)), power-law for self-citation effects (penalty ∝ (SCR-β)^γ), and threshold/interaction effects for temporal windows.</li>
                <li>Transformation is multidimensional, characterized by at least three dimensions: (1) displacement vs consolidation (D-index), (2) theoretical vs methodological vs empirical contributions, and (3) conceptual vs interdisciplinary vs technical novelty.</li>
                <li>Gap magnitudes are context-dependent: minimal (<20%) for within-domain well-calibrated proxies, moderate (20-40%) for cross-domain or uncalibrated proxies, large (40-60%) for short-window or prestige-based proxies, and very large (>60%) for multiple compounding failures.</li>
                <li>Proxy metrics are implicitly calibrated on the distribution of incremental science in their training data, creating systematic undervaluation of out-of-distribution (transformational) discoveries.</li>
                <li>Multiple proxy failures compound multiplicatively rather than additively: citation-based proxies fail due to delayed recognition; prestige-based proxies fail because transformational work may come from non-traditional venues; author-reputation proxies fail because transformational work often comes from unexpected sources; methodology-familiarity proxies fail because transformational work uses novel approaches.</li>
                <li>The gap is time-dependent with stabilization periods: D-index requires ≥10 years to stabilize, with empirical turning points for relationship reversals around 10 years, because ground truth eventually manifests through long-term impact measures while automated systems typically operate on short-term proxies.</li>
                <li>Fields with higher paradigm rigidity (physics, mathematics) show larger gaps for transformational work than fields with more flexible paradigms (ecology, social sciences), operationalized through field-specific β parameters.</li>
                <li>Data quality moderates gap magnitude: measurement artifacts (missing references, citation inflation, training-data truncation, document-type mixing) can create or amplify apparent gaps independent of genuine proxy failures.</li>
                <li>Ground truth is uncertain and requires multiple complementary measures: citations, disruption indices, expert judgment (which itself shows moderate agreement with kappa 0.287-0.368), replication, and translational outcomes may not fully align.</li>
                <li>The gap can be reduced through multiple complementary correction approaches: structured retrieval and prompting, relative density normalization, field-specific calibration, hybrid human-AI workflows, topological methods, entropy-weighted loss for rare samples, deviation-aware alignment, and portfolio strategies.</li>
                <li>Self-citation effects compound temporally: each self-citation generates approximately 3 additional citations over 5 years, creating cumulative advantage that inflates proxy metrics by 13.9% on average and up to 25% for high self-citers.</li>
                <li>Consolidating/validating work can be transformative despite low displacement scores, indicating that displacement-based measures capture one but not all forms of transformational impact.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Multiple studies confirm systematic undervaluation of novel work by traditional proxies: Boudreau-2016 shows reviewers consistently penalize novel proposals with bias magnitude sufficient to fully offset the novelty premium; Campanario-2009 catalogs 24 Nobel-winning papers initially rejected; Jacob & Lefgren 2011 finds no significant output differences between funded/unfunded near-cutoff proposals. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1894.html#e1894.1" class="evidence-link">[e1894.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1894.html#e1894.3" class="evidence-link">[e1894.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1894.html#e1894.2" class="evidence-link">[e1894.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1894.html#e1894.0" class="evidence-link">[e1894.0]</a> </li>
    <li>D-index research demonstrates hyperbolic relationship G ≈ d_p/(1+b_p) where median b_p≈119 implies local displacement is scaled down ~100x, explaining large gaps between raw citations and displacement-based impact. Watson & Crick (D=0.96) vs Human Genome Project (D≈-0.017) despite both having high citations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.0" class="evidence-link">[e1897.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.1" class="evidence-link">[e1897.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1893.html#e1893.1" class="evidence-link">[e1893.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.4" class="evidence-link">[e1897.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Citation-window effects demonstrate threshold/interaction temporal patterns: short 5-year windows can reverse inferred relationships, disruptive work requires ≥10 years to stabilize, empirical turning point at ~10 years, consistent with delayed recognition for transformational work. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.3" class="evidence-link">[e1897.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.6" class="evidence-link">[e1897.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1895.html#e1895.5" class="evidence-link">[e1895.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Self-citation shows power-law compounding effects: each self-citation generates ~3 additional citations over 5 years, with average 13.9% inflation overall and up to 25% adjustment for high self-citers (SCR>0.2), modeled as (SCR-β)^γ penalty. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1895.html#e1895.0" class="evidence-link">[e1895.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1895.html#e1895.4" class="evidence-link">[e1895.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1895.html#e1895.2" class="evidence-link">[e1895.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1895.html#e1895.1" class="evidence-link">[e1895.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Automated systems trained on historical data amplify existing biases: ML systems favor highly-cited work and established researchers, worsening proxy-to-ground-truth mismatch for novel discoveries unless corrected. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1889.html#e1889.4" class="evidence-link">[e1889.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1889.html#e1889.0" class="evidence-link">[e1889.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1889.html#e1889.5" class="evidence-link">[e1889.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Field-specific differences support paradigm rigidity parameter β: RND shows CS models perform better than biomedical (AUROC 0.80 vs 0.60); different fields show different self-citation patterns (Engineering 22%, Humanities 9%); prestige effects vary by field. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1892.html#e1892.0" class="evidence-link">[e1892.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1895.html#e1895.0" class="evidence-link">[e1895.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1891.html#e1891.2" class="evidence-link">[e1891.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1894.html#e1894.7" class="evidence-link">[e1894.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Embedding-based systems show systematic failures due to training distribution bias: top2vec omits unseen words and fails to integrate novel post-training documents, with pre-training documents showing statistically higher mixup (193.2 vs 187.9, p<0.0001). <a href="../results/extraction-result-1891.html#e1891.4" class="evidence-link">[e1891.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1891.html#e1891.0" class="evidence-link">[e1891.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple proxy failures compound multiplicatively: citation inflation interacts with reference-length confounding and dataset completeness; journal self-citation distorts prestige metrics; LLM systems without retrieval fail completely (AUROC≈0.50) while those with retrieval show domain-dependent failures. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.6" class="evidence-link">[e1897.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.7" class="evidence-link">[e1897.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1895.html#e1895.6" class="evidence-link">[e1895.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1892.html#e1892.1" class="evidence-link">[e1892.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Correction approaches demonstrate gap reduction: structured retrieval and prompting achieves 86.5% reasoning alignment; DI-prediction improves hit rates by ~9 percentage points to 24-28%; SCAI reduces self-citation inflation; RND achieves 0.795 cross-domain AUROC vs 0.362-0.395 for absolute density. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1896.html#e1896.1" class="evidence-link">[e1896.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1893.html#e1893.4" class="evidence-link">[e1893.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1893.html#e1893.0" class="evidence-link">[e1893.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1895.html#e1895.0" class="evidence-link">[e1895.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1892.html#e1892.0" class="evidence-link">[e1892.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Context-dependent gap magnitudes observed: minimal gaps for within-domain calibrated proxies (HD AUROC 0.85, expert survey AUC 0.83); moderate gaps cross-domain (RND improvement ~20%, LLM domain drop ~20%, self-citation inflation ~14%); large gaps for compounding failures (absolute density cross-domain drop ~0.49). <a href="../results/extraction-result-1892.html#e1892.0" class="evidence-link">[e1892.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1892.html#e1892.1" class="evidence-link">[e1892.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1895.html#e1895.0" class="evidence-link">[e1895.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.2" class="evidence-link">[e1897.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.3" class="evidence-link">[e1897.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Automated evaluation systems using relative density normalization (like RND) will show 15-25% smaller cross-domain performance drops compared to absolute density methods when evaluating novel work across different scientific fields.</li>
                <li>Papers combining concepts from three or more distant domains will show 30-50% larger proxy-truth gaps than papers within single domains when evaluated using citation-based metrics within 5 years, but this gap will reduce to 10-20% after 10+ years.</li>
                <li>Implementing field-specific calibration parameters (β) in automated systems will reduce proxy-truth gaps by 20-35% for moderately transformational work (middle tercile of novelty distribution) compared to uncalibrated systems.</li>
                <li>Hybrid evaluation systems combining structured retrieval with LLM-based assessment will achieve 75-85% reasoning alignment with expert judgment for novelty assessment, compared to 40-50% for LLMs without retrieval.</li>
                <li>Self-citation adjustment using power-law penalties (SCR-β)^γ will more accurately predict long-term external impact than binary exclusion of all self-citations, with 10-15% improvement in correlation with 10-year citation counts.</li>
                <li>Papers from researchers at institutions in the bottom quartile of prestige rankings will show 25-40% larger initial proxy-truth gaps than equivalent-quality papers from top-quartile institutions, but this gap will reduce to <10% after 8-10 years.</li>
                <li>Topological data analysis methods (persistent homology, mixup barcodes) will identify 60-75% of highly interdisciplinary papers that traditional citation-based metrics miss in the first 3 years post-publication.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If automated systems are trained on curated datasets of historically transformational discoveries weighted by their disruption indices rather than citation counts, they might either improve identification of future transformational work by 40-60%, or might overfit to past patterns of transformation that don't generalize to fundamentally new paradigm shifts.</li>
                <li>Implementing portfolio optimization approaches that explicitly reserve 20-30% of funding for high-novelty/high-uncertainty projects might either accelerate scientific progress by 15-25% over 10-year periods, or might waste resources on low-quality high-risk work if novelty detection is insufficiently accurate.</li>
                <li>As AI systems themselves begin generating scientific discoveries at scale, the proxy-truth gap patterns might fundamentally change because AI-generated discoveries may have different novelty distributions, citation patterns, and impact trajectories than human-generated discoveries, potentially requiring entirely new evaluation frameworks.</li>
                <li>If the scientific community increasingly relies on automated evaluation systems with uncorrected proxy-truth gaps, this might create a feedback loop where transformational work becomes exponentially more disadvantaged over 2-3 funding cycles, potentially causing a 30-50% reduction in paradigm-shifting discoveries, or might trigger corrective institutional responses that prevent such decline.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple complementary correction approaches (structured retrieval + relative normalization + field calibration + topological methods) might either achieve near-complete gap closure (<10% residual gap) for most transformational work, or might reveal fundamental limits where certain types of paradigm-shifting work remain inherently undetectable by any automated system until after the paradigm shift occurs.</li>
                <li>Training reasoning models using disruption index predictions as reward signals in reinforcement learning might either produce systems that genuinely identify transformational combinations with 70-80% accuracy, or might create systems that game the disruption metric without producing genuinely impactful work.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If proxy-truth gaps are found to be constant or decreasing (rather than increasing) with transformation degree across multiple proxy types and contexts, the core prediction of systematic undervaluation would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If transformational discoveries show the same or smaller gaps than incremental discoveries when using 10+ year citation windows across multiple fields, the theory's claim about delayed recognition would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If gaps do not show multiplicative compounding across different proxy failure modes (citations, prestige, author reputation) but instead show simple additive effects, the theory's mechanistic explanation would be invalidated.</li>
                <li>If automated systems trained exclusively on transformational discoveries show the same gap patterns as systems trained on typical publications, the training distribution bias hypothesis would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If field-specific calibration and relative normalization approaches fail to reduce cross-domain gaps compared to uncalibrated absolute methods, the theory's claims about field-specific β parameters and correction approaches would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If consolidating/validating work consistently shows larger long-term impact than displacement-based measures predict across multiple domains, the theory's emphasis on displacement as a key dimension of transformation would need fundamental revision.</li>
                <li>If data quality improvements (complete reference data, consistent document types, proper citation tracking) eliminate most observed gaps, this would suggest gaps are primarily measurement artifacts rather than genuine proxy failures.</li>
                <li>If human expert judgment shows high agreement (kappa >0.7) on novelty assessment and automated systems can match this with simple methods, the theory's claim about fundamental proxy-truth divergence would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain why some transformational discoveries receive rapid recognition (some highly novel work succeeds rapidly per Uzzi et al.) while others face prolonged delays, suggesting additional factors beyond proxy failures and field characteristics. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.0" class="evidence-link">[e1897.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.2" class="evidence-link">[e1897.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of scientific communication, framing, and presentation quality in modulating the proxy-truth gap is not addressed - transformational work that is well-communicated may show substantially smaller gaps than poorly communicated work of equal scientific merit. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1896.html#e1896.0" class="evidence-link">[e1896.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The influence of social networks, collaboration patterns, and institutional prestige on proxy-truth gaps is acknowledged but not fully integrated into the quantitative framework - these factors may interact with transformation dimensions in complex ways. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1894.html#e1894.7" class="evidence-link">[e1894.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1894.html#e1894.0" class="evidence-link">[e1894.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for how crisis periods, funding ecosystem structure, or field-level receptivity to novelty might temporarily reduce gaps - some contexts may be more receptive to transformational work than the theory predicts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1894.html#e1894.7" class="evidence-link">[e1894.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Consolidating/validating work can be transformative despite negative disruption scores (Ketterle's Bose-Einstein condensation D=-0.58 but Nobel-winning; Human Genome Project D≈-0.017 but influential), indicating displacement-based measures don't capture all forms of transformational impact. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1897.html#e1897.0" class="evidence-link">[e1897.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The exact mechanisms by which different types of transformation (theoretical breakthroughs vs methodological innovations vs empirical discoveries vs integrative syntheses) produce different gap patterns are not fully specified. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1890.html#e1890.1" class="evidence-link">[e1890.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1891.html#e1891.3" class="evidence-link">[e1891.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how emerging evaluation technologies (OS agents for literature access, specialized platforms like AIXIV, multi-agent simulations) might fundamentally alter proxy-truth relationships in ways not captured by current correction approaches. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1890.html#e1890.4" class="evidence-link">[e1890.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1890.html#e1890.3" class="evidence-link">[e1890.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1889.html#e1889.1" class="evidence-link">[e1889.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The relationship between different ground truth measures (citations, D-index, expert judgment, replication, translational outcomes) and which should be considered most authoritative for different types of transformation is not fully resolved. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1892.html#e1892.2" class="evidence-link">[e1892.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1896.html#e1896.5" class="evidence-link">[e1896.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1894.html#e1894.5" class="evidence-link">[e1894.5]</a> </li>

    "theory_description": "This theory posits that the divergence between proxy metrics (used by automated evaluation systems) and ground truth scientific value follows systematic patterns based on multiple dimensions of transformation, with different functional forms depending on proxy type and context. Proxy metrics are calibrated on historical data that predominantly reflects incremental science, creating 'training distribution bias' that causes automated systems to systematically undervalue transformational work. The gap magnitude G is context-dependent and follows different mathematical relationships: hyperbolic for displacement-based measures (G ≈ d/(1+b) where d is local displacement and b is knowledge burden), power-law for self-citation effects (penalty ∝ (SCR-β)^γ), and threshold/interaction effects for temporal windows. Transformation is characterized by at least three dimensions: (1) displacement vs consolidation, (2) theoretical vs methodological vs empirical contributions, and (3) conceptual vs interdisciplinary vs technical novelty. Gap magnitudes range from minimal (&lt;20%) for within-domain well-calibrated proxies to very large (&gt;60%) for multiple compounding failures. The theory predicts that proxies based on citation patterns, journal prestige, author reputation, and methodological familiarity will show increasing divergence from ground truth as discoveries become more transformational, with magnitude critically dependent on proxy type, field characteristics (paradigm rigidity β), temporal window length, and data quality. The gap represents systematic bias that can be characterized and corrected through multiple complementary approaches including structured retrieval, relative density normalization, field-specific calibration, hybrid human-AI workflows, topological methods, and portfolio strategies. Ground truth itself is recognized as uncertain and requiring multiple complementary measures.",
