                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-170</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contact and Friction Fidelity Requirements for Manipulation Transfer</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about minimal simulator fidelity requirements for training transferable scientific reasoning in domains such as thermodynamics, circuits, and biology, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For robotic manipulation tasks involving contact-rich interactions, successful sim-to-real transfer requires accurate modeling of contact detection, contact forces, friction, and their interaction with actuator dynamics. The required fidelity depends on task characteristics: (1) Contact detection must reliably identify collisions without false positives/negatives; (2) Contact force models must balance penetration prevention with numerical stability through appropriate stiffness and damping; (3) Friction models must capture both static and dynamic friction with coefficients matched to real materials or broadly randomized; (4) Contact solver parameters (timestep, iterations, tolerance) must be tuned to task precision requirements; (5) Contact modeling must be coupled with accurate actuator dynamics and latency modeling. Simplified contact models (penalty-based, impulse-based) are acceptable if parameters are well-tuned or randomized across appropriate ranges, but completely omitting contact modeling or using grossly incorrect parameters causes transfer failure. The minimum required contact fidelity scales with task precision: coarse manipulation tolerates simplified models, while precision assembly requires detailed contact geometry and tight solver tolerances.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Contact detection must reliably identify when objects are in contact; missed contacts cause objects to pass through each other (e.g., PyBullet gripper over cube), false contacts cause spurious collisions</li>
                <li>Contact force models must prevent or limit penetration while maintaining numerical stability; excessive penetration causes unrealistic behavior, excessive stiffness causes numerical instability and oscillations</li>
                <li>Friction models must distinguish static (sticking) and dynamic (sliding) friction; incorrect friction coefficients cause objects to slip when they should stick or stick when they should slide</li>
                <li>Contact solver parameters (iterations, tolerance, timestep) significantly affect behavior and must be tuned to task requirements; insufficient iterations cause soft/compliant contacts, excessive iterations are computationally expensive but may be necessary for precision tasks</li>
                <li>Randomization of contact parameters (friction coefficients 0.5-1.25, contact stiffness, damping) can compensate for modeling errors and improve robustness when exact parameters are unknown</li>
                <li>Contact modeling must be coupled with accurate actuator dynamics and latency modeling; contact modeling alone is insufficient without proper actuator fidelity</li>
                <li>The minimum required contact fidelity scales with task precision: coarse manipulation (grasping, pushing) tolerates simplified penalty-based models, while precision tasks (assembly, surgical manipulation) require detailed contact geometry and tight solver tolerances</li>
                <li>Different physics engines with similar contact models can produce different behaviors due to solver implementation, integration method, and default parameter choices; engine selection and configuration matter as much as the contact model itself</li>
                <li>Damping parameters are particularly difficult to identify and optimize, yet significantly affect contact behavior and transfer success</li>
                <li>Curriculum learning from soft/relaxed contacts to stiff/realistic contacts enables optimization in contact-rich scenarios where direct optimization in high-fidelity contact models fails</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>MuJoCo's simplified contact/damping models contributed to sim-to-real gaps; damping parameters were particularly challenging for baselines to identify/optimize, and unmodeled stochastic forces caused mismatches <a href="../results/extraction-result-1310.html#e1310.0" class="evidence-link">[e1310.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1310.html#e1310.1" class="evidence-link">[e1310.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Accurate timestep, friction (lateral/rolling/sliding), and contact parameters were critical for manipulation transfer across multiple physics engines (V-Rep with Bullet, ODE, Newton, Vortex) <a href="../results/extraction-result-1523.html#e1523.1" class="evidence-link">[e1523.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1523.html#e1523.2" class="evidence-link">[e1523.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1523.html#e1523.4" class="evidence-link">[e1523.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Contact and collision modeling were necessary for manipulation transfer; PyBullet's contact failures (gripper passing over cube) demonstrated importance of contact detection, while good kinematic fidelity alone was insufficient <a href="../results/extraction-result-1537.html#e1537.1" class="evidence-link">[e1537.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1537.html#e1537.3" class="evidence-link">[e1537.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Permissive collision model in SOFA simulation led to excessive tissue stress and collisions in reality for surgical manipulation, demonstrating need for accurate contact constraints <a href="../results/extraction-result-1307.html#e1307.0" class="evidence-link">[e1307.0]</a> </li>
    <li>QuasiSim's parameterized contact model (distance threshold d_c, spring stiffness k_n, damping k_d, friction stiffness k_f) required curriculum from soft/relaxed contacts to stiff/tight contacts for successful optimization and transfer to high-fidelity simulators <a href="../results/extraction-result-1317.html#e1317.0" class="evidence-link">[e1317.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Different Bullet versions and integration methods exhibited different contact behavior (oscillations, unrealistic cube rotations) depending on solver settings, timestep, and host integration, showing contact fidelity depends on implementation details <a href="../results/extraction-result-1537.html#e1537.3" class="evidence-link">[e1537.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Domain randomization of friction coefficients (0.5-1.25 for contact friction, 0-0.05 Nm for motor friction) and contact parameters improved manipulation transfer robustness <a href="../results/extraction-result-1328.html#e1328.0" class="evidence-link">[e1328.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1506.html#e1506.2" class="evidence-link">[e1506.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1534.html#e1534.2" class="evidence-link">[e1534.2]</a> </li>
    <li>MuJoCo review notes that contact and friction modeling matter for manipulation, and that different engines show deficits in dynamic contacts; no single engine uniformly best due to solver and contact/friction modeling differences <a href="../results/extraction-result-1321.html#e1321.0" class="evidence-link">[e1321.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1321.html#e1321.1" class="evidence-link">[e1321.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Vanilla PyBullet without augmented contact/friction modeling failed to reproduce real robot behavior for BALLU; adding residual physics for contacts improved transfer <a href="../results/extraction-result-1327.html#e1327.1" class="evidence-link">[e1327.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Ellipsoidal limit-surface contact model for planar pushing captured quasi-static contact but failed to predict many real outcomes due to coarse contact approximations and inability to capture heterogeneous friction <a href="../results/extraction-result-1525.html#e1525.1" class="evidence-link">[e1525.1]</a> </li>
    <li>gradSim's differentiable physics with contact modeling enabled system identification from images; dynamics mismatch caused larger errors than rendering mismatch <a href="../results/extraction-result-1536.html#e1536.1" class="evidence-link">[e1536.1]</a> </li>
    <li>ODE in V-Rep produced unstable simulation with self-contacts for Kinova arm, demonstrating that default contact parameters can make engines unusable <a href="../results/extraction-result-1537.html#e1537.6" class="evidence-link">[e1537.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Vortex modeled control well but exhibited limited fidelity in cube interaction due to poor contact modeling <a href="../results/extraction-result-1537.html#e1537.5" class="evidence-link">[e1537.5]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Penalty-based contact models with randomized stiffness (range covering 0.5-2x nominal) and damping should enable transfer for manipulation tasks with moderate contact forces and tolerances >5mm</li>
                <li>Impulse-based contact models with randomized friction coefficients (0.5-1.5x nominal) should enable transfer for dynamic manipulation (throwing, hitting) where contact duration is brief</li>
                <li>Simplified contact models (point contacts, no rolling friction) should suffice for grasping tasks where contact geometry is simple and forces are primarily normal to surfaces</li>
                <li>For precision assembly tasks requiring <1mm tolerances, contact solver iterations should be increased by 2-5x over default values and timestep reduced by 2-4x</li>
                <li>Domain randomization of contact parameters combined with accurate actuator modeling should outperform high-fidelity contact models with idealized actuators</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether simplified contact models can enable transfer for precision assembly tasks requiring <0.5mm tolerances, or if detailed contact geometry and mesh-level collision detection become necessary</li>
                <li>The minimum contact solver fidelity (iterations, timestep) required as a function of contact stiffness and task precision - whether there is a quantitative relationship or task-specific tuning is always required</li>
                <li>Whether soft-body contact models are necessary for transfer to deformable object manipulation, or if rigid-body models with appropriate compliance parameters suffice</li>
                <li>Whether learned residual contact models can compensate for simplified analytical contact models across a wide range of materials and geometries, or if material-specific tuning is required</li>
                <li>The extent to which contact model errors can be compensated by other randomizations (actuator, sensor noise) versus requiring direct contact parameter tuning</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that contact-free models (e.g., magnetic levitation, non-contact manipulation) enable transfer to contact-rich tasks would challenge the contact modeling requirement</li>
                <li>Demonstrating successful transfer with systematically incorrect friction models (e.g., friction coefficients off by 2-5x) would challenge the friction accuracy requirement</li>
                <li>Showing that extremely coarse contact approximations (e.g., bounding boxes only, no friction) enable precise manipulation (<1mm tolerance) would challenge the fidelity scaling hypothesis</li>
                <li>Finding that contact modeling without actuator dynamics modeling enables reliable transfer would challenge the coupling requirement</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that fixed contact parameters (no randomization) enable transfer across diverse materials and geometries would challenge the randomization strategy</li>
            </ol>
