                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Signal Aggregation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can accurately measure the probability of specific future scientific discoveries by aggregating weak, distributed signals embedded in the scientific literature, preprints, and discourse. These signals include citation patterns, co-occurrence of concepts, shifts in terminology, and the emergence of new research clusters. By integrating these latent signals, LLMs can detect the 'momentum' or 'trajectory' of scientific progress toward particular discoveries, enabling probabilistic forecasting.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs cannot distinguish between topics with and without genuine discovery momentum, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' probability estimates do not correlate with actual discovery rates, the theory is called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Discoveries arising from isolated or non-textual research efforts may not be preceded by detectable latent signals. </li>
