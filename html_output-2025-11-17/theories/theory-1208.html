                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1208</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Conditioned Representation Adaptation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs capable of dynamically adapting their internal chemical representations in response to the specific requirements of a synthesis task (e.g., property constraints, novelty, safety) will outperform static-representation models. The adaptation is driven by task-conditioning signals, allowing the LLM to emphasize relevant chemical features and suppress irrelevant ones, thereby enhancing both expressivity and robustness in a context-dependent manner.</p>
