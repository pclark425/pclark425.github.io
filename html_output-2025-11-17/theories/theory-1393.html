                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as a Multi-Stage Information Bottleneck and Error Correction Process</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that each stage of iterative self-reflection in language models acts as an information bottleneck, selectively filtering out error-related information while preserving relevant content. Each reflection pass compresses the output, reducing the mutual information between the output and prior error states, and amplifies error signals for correction. This process enables the model to progressively refine its answers, minimizing both explicit and implicit errors through a combination of information compression and targeted error correction.</p>
