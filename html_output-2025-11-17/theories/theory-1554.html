                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1554</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Transient Wormhole Generation via Controlled Quantum Entanglement</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by leveraging large-scale, engineered quantum entanglement and negative energy densities (e.g., via squeezed vacuum states), it is possible to transiently stabilize microscopic wormholes, allowing information or small probes to traverse spacetime at effective FTL speeds. The approach focuses on using quantum optical techniques and advanced materials to create and maintain the exotic energy conditions required for traversable wormholes, within the constraints of current or near-future experimental capabilities.</p>

                <li>Sustained operation of such a wormhole will not violate causality or produce observable paradoxes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If no effective FTL signal transfer is observed in engineered entangled, negative-energy regions, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If attempts to stabilize wormholes with negative energy fail due to quantum inequalities, the theory is undermined.</li>
