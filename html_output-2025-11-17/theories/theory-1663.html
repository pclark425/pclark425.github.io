                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1663</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Interactive Contextualization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is determined by their ability to dynamically contextualize prompts using both explicit context (prompt content, instructions) and implicit context (prior conversational turns, user intent, and subdomain-specific discourse patterns). Effective contextualization enables LLMs to simulate subdomain reasoning processes, while failures in contextualization lead to context drift, misinterpretation, or loss of scientific rigor.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are equipped with explicit context-tracking modules, their ability to simulate complex scientific reasoning over long dialogues will improve beyond current baselines.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs maintain high simulation accuracy despite context loss or misalignment, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If providing subdomain-specific context does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>

    <li>LLMs sometimes recover context or correct themselves mid-dialogue, even after apparent context drift. </li>
