                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional Evaluation Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires the alignment of multiple explicit and implicit evaluative dimensions (e.g., accuracy, novelty, coherence, ethicality, and latent factors such as bias or conceptual depth). The theory asserts that robust evaluation emerges only when these dimensions are systematically identified, weighted, and integrated, and that misalignment among these dimensions can lead to inconsistent or unreliable assessments.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Evaluation frameworks that explicitly align and weight multiple dimensions will yield higher inter-rater reliability than single-metric or unweighted approaches.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Some implicit dimensions may interact nonlinearly with explicit ones, leading to emergent evaluation patterns not predictable from individual criteria.</li>
                <li>Overweighting certain dimensions (e.g., novelty) may systematically bias evaluation outcomes in ways that are context-dependent and difficult to anticipate.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If adding implicit or latent dimensions does not improve reliability or validity of evaluation outcomes, the alignment law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If context-sensitive weighting does not affect or improve the predictive power of evaluation scores, the dimension weighting law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify optimal methods for discovering or quantifying implicit dimensions in practice. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to resolve conflicts when different evaluators assign divergent weights to dimensions. </li>
