                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memory Consolidation and Recall-Frequency Law for Personalized Dialogue Agents (General Theory)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the effectiveness of language model agents in task-solving is governed by the dynamic interplay between memory consolidation (the process of integrating and abstracting past interactions) and recall-frequency (the rate and context in which memories are retrieved). The theory asserts that optimal performance arises when agents adaptively consolidate salient experiences and modulate recall frequency based on task demands, user preferences, and context, leading to improved personalization, coherence, and task success.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Human memory research shows that salient or emotionally charged events are more likely to be consolidated into long-term memory, and that abstraction/generalization is a key part of memory consolidation. </li>
    <li>Recent LLM-based agents with episodic memory modules show improved performance when salient events are selectively consolidated. </li>
    <li>Cognitive science demonstrates that consolidation involves both selection (salience) and transformation (abstraction) of experiences. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies in continual learning for neural networks show that selective consolidation reduces catastrophic forgetting and improves generalization. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While salience-driven consolidation is known in cognitive science, its formalization as a law for LLM agents and its link to task performance is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The importance of salience in human and artificial memory consolidation is well-established in cognitive science and some LLM memory architectures.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit law that adaptive, context-driven consolidation and abstraction of salient events is necessary for optimal agent performance is new in the context of LLM dialogue agents.</p>
