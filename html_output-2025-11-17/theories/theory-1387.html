                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1387</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Metacognitive Processing in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when prompted to reflect, exhibit emergent metacognitive behaviors—such as uncertainty estimation, error detection, and self-evaluation—despite lacking explicit metacognitive modules. These behaviors arise from the model's ability to simulate multiple perspectives and reason about its own outputs, leading to improved answer quality through self-monitoring and adaptive revision.</p>
