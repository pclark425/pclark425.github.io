                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scholarly literature, can semantically aggregate and abstract recurring quantitative relationships, enabling the emergence of new, generalizable quantitative laws that may not be explicitly stated in any single paper. The LLM's internal representations allow it to synthesize, interpolate, and extrapolate across disparate findings, thus distilling robust quantitative laws from noisy, heterogeneous scientific data.</p>

    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to synthesize and summarize complex relationships from large text corpora, including extracting equations and quantitative trends not explicitly stated in any single source. </li>
    <li>Meta-analyses and systematic reviews by humans often reveal new quantitative laws by aggregating results; LLMs can automate and scale this process. </li>
    <li>Tshitoyan et al. (2019) showed that unsupervised word embeddings trained on materials science literature captured latent knowledge, including implicit quantitative relationships. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to meta-analysis and LLM summarization, the idea that LLMs can discover new, emergent quantitative laws by semantic aggregation is not established in the literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Meta-analyses and systematic reviews aggregate quantitative findings, and LLMs are known to summarize and extract information from text.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The theory that LLMs can autonomously synthesize emergent, generalizable quantitative laws from distributed, implicit evidence across a corpus is novel.</p>
