                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that integrates criteria such as logical coherence, empirical testability, explanatory power, novelty, and ethical/societal impact. Each dimension is assessed independently and then synthesized to provide a holistic evaluation score, enabling both automated and human-in-the-loop assessment.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Scientific theory evaluation in philosophy and practice is multi-criteria (e.g., Kuhn, Lakatos, meta-science literature). </li>
    <li>LLMs can generate plausible but flawed or unethical theories, necessitating multi-faceted evaluation. </li>

    <li>Meta-scientific frameworks often combine multiple criteria for overall assessment. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is somewhat-related-to-existing, but its application to LLM-generated theory evaluation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Synthesis of multiple evaluation criteria is common in scientific and technical review.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Explicit formalization and automation for LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-generated theories that score highly across all dimensions will be more likely to be accepted by expert reviewers.</li>
                <li>Automated multi-dimensional scoring will correlate with human expert judgments of theory quality.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Some theories may score poorly on one dimension (e.g., empirical testability) but highly on others (e.g., explanatory power), leading to ambiguous overall evaluation.</li>
                <li>Novelty scoring may undervalue paradigm-shifting but initially implausible theories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If theories with high holistic scores are consistently rejected by experts, the synthesis law is flawed.</li>
                <li>If the system fails to distinguish between logically incoherent and coherent theories, the multi-dimensional assessment law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the dynamic evolution of theory quality as new evidence emerges. </li>
