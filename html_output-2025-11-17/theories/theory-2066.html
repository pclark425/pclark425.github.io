                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2066</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative LLM-Human Co-Discovery of Quantitative Laws</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective distillation of quantitative laws from scholarly papers arises from an iterative, interactive process between LLMs and human experts. LLMs generate candidate laws and highlight supporting evidence, while humans provide critical evaluation, correction, and domain-specific insight. This feedback loop refines both the LLM's extraction/generation process and the quality of the discovered laws, leading to more robust, generalizable scientific knowledge.</p>
