                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about variability and reproducibility in language model-driven scientific experimentation.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model-driven scientific experimentation operates within a three-dimensional constraint space defined by alignment (task performance/correctness), entropy (output diversity/uncertainty), and stability (reproducibility across perturbations). These three dimensions form a triangle where optimizing any two necessarily constrains the third, creating fundamental trade-offs. Specifically: (1) High alignment + low entropy → low stability (precise but brittle systems via techniques like chain-of-thought); (2) High alignment + high stability → high entropy (robust but uncertain systems via ensemble methods); (3) Low entropy + high stability → low alignment (reproducible but potentially incorrect systems via simple prompting). The theory explains variability in LM-driven science as movement through this triangle space, where different prompting strategies occupy different regions. This framework predicts that achieving all three properties simultaneously is impossible without fundamental architectural changes, and that apparent improvements in one dimension often mask degradation in others.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The alignment-entropy-stability space forms a constrained triangle where maximizing any two dimensions necessarily limits the third, creating fundamental trade-offs in LM-driven experimentation.</li>
                <li>High-alignment techniques (chain-of-thought, detailed instructions, optimized prompts) create narrow, high-performance pathways through representation space that increase brittleness, moving systems toward the high-alignment/low-entropy/low-stability vertex.</li>
                <li>Stability-enhancing approaches (ensemble methods, self-consistency, prompt averaging) require accepting higher entropy in the form of output diversity or uncertainty quantification.</li>
                <li>Low-entropy systems (deterministic, single-path reasoning with low temperature) can achieve high stability but sacrifice alignment on tasks requiring exploration or creativity.</li>
                <li>The position within the triangle is determined by: P_triangle = f(prompt_complexity, sampling_strategy, model_architecture, task_requirements), where different scientific tasks have different optimal positions.</li>
                <li>Instruction fine-tuning and RLHF shift the entire triangle space, potentially expanding the feasible region but not eliminating the fundamental trade-offs.</li>
                <li>Movement along triangle edges represents different reproducibility strategies: alignment-stability edge (deterministic high-performance), stability-entropy edge (robust uncertainty quantification), entropy-alignment edge (diverse high-quality outputs).</li>
                <li>The brittleness coefficient B increases super-linearly with alignment optimization: B ∝ (alignment_gain)^α where α > 1, meaning diminishing returns on stability as alignment improves.</li>
                <li>Scientific reproducibility requires explicitly choosing a position in the triangle based on experimental requirements: verification tasks favor low-entropy/high-stability, exploratory tasks favor high-entropy/high-alignment, and production systems require balanced positions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning performance (high alignment) but shows high sensitivity to specific examples and phrasing (low stability). </li>
    <li>Self-consistency methods that sample multiple reasoning paths improve robustness (increase stability) but require accepting higher output diversity (higher entropy). </li>
    <li>Few-shot learning performance varies dramatically based on example selection and ordering (low stability), despite improving task performance (high alignment). </li>
    <li>Minor prompt modifications lead to significant performance differences in complex reasoning tasks, demonstrating the alignment-stability trade-off. </li>
    <li>More detailed and specific prompts improve task performance (alignment) but reduce generalization to related formulations (stability). </li>
    <li>Instruction-tuned models show improved robustness to prompt variations (higher stability) compared to base models, but this comes with constraints on output diversity. </li>
    <li>Temperature and sampling parameters directly control entropy, with lower temperatures reducing diversity but potentially improving stability at the cost of alignment on creative tasks. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Measuring alignment, entropy, and stability metrics across different prompting strategies will reveal that they occupy distinct regions of the triangle space, with no strategy achieving maximal values on all three dimensions simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Scientific experiments using chain-of-thought prompting will show 2-3x higher output variance (lower stability) across semantically equivalent prompt reformulations compared to zero-shot prompting, but with 40-60% better task performance (higher alignment).</li>
                <li>Implementing self-consistency with k=10 samples will improve stability by 30-50% compared to single-sample chain-of-thought, but will increase entropy (measured by output diversity) by 2-4x.</li>
                <li>Plotting different prompting strategies in alignment-stability space will show a negative correlation (r < -0.6) between these dimensions for complex reasoning tasks.</li>
                <li>Temperature sweeps will reveal that optimal alignment and optimal stability occur at different temperature values, with stability maximized at T≈0.3 and alignment maximized at task-dependent T≈0.7-1.0.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist 'Pareto-optimal prompting strategies' that define the boundary of the feasible triangle region—discovering these would provide fundamental limits on LM-driven scientific reproducibility.</li>
                <li>Novel architectures (e.g., mixture-of-experts, retrieval-augmented models) might expand the feasible triangle region, potentially allowing higher simultaneous values across all three dimensions—this would be transformative for scientific applications.</li>
                <li>The triangle geometry might change with model scale, with larger models potentially showing different trade-off slopes—if larger models can achieve better positions across all dimensions, this would justify computational investment.</li>
                <li>Meta-learning approaches that explicitly optimize for triangle position (multi-objective optimization across alignment, entropy, stability) might discover novel prompting strategies that outperform human-designed approaches.</li>
                <li>The triangle framework might generalize to other AI systems (vision models, multimodal models), suggesting universal constraints on AI-driven scientific experimentation—or it might be LM-specific.</li>
                <li>Adversarial training on prompt variations might shift the triangle geometry, potentially trading some peak alignment for broader stability—the magnitude of this effect is unknown but could be substantial.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding a prompting strategy that simultaneously achieves top-quartile performance on alignment, entropy control, and stability metrics would falsify the fundamental triangle constraint hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that chain-of-thought prompting produces more stable outputs across prompt variations than zero-shot prompting (without sacrificing alignment) would contradict the alignment-stability trade-off.</li>
                <li>Showing that increasing prompt specificity consistently improves both alignment and stability would invalidate the theory's core trade-off mechanism.</li>
                <li>Finding that entropy and stability are positively correlated (rather than representing different dimensions) would collapse the triangle to a two-dimensional space.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that instruction fine-tuning eliminates the trade-offs entirely (rather than shifting the triangle) would falsify the claim about fundamental constraints.</li>
                <li>Showing that the same prompting strategy occupies the same triangle position across different task types would contradict the task-dependency claim.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how model scale interacts with triangle geometry—larger models might show different trade-off slopes or expanded feasible regions. </li>
    <li>The role of pre-training data distribution in determining baseline triangle position is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for how multi-turn interactions or iterative refinement might allow navigation through triangle space over time. </li>
    <li>The interaction between triangle position and specific scientific domains (e.g., mathematics vs. biology) is not fully characterized. </li>
