                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> </p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Despite strong performance on text-based ToM tasks, LLMs lack genuine theory-of-mind capabilities because they are trained solely on static text corpora without grounding in real-world sensory, social, or interactive experiences. This absence limits their ability to form robust mental state representations and to connect linguistic inferences to actual social cognition.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training solely on static text limits LLMs' ability to develop genuine ToM.</li>
                <li>Lack of grounding in sensory and social environments constrains mental state understanding.</li>
                <li>LLMs cannot reliably connect mental state inferences to real-world actions.</li>
                <li>Interactive and multimodal learning paradigms are necessary for robust ToM.</li>
                <li>Current LLMs exhibit illusory ToM that does not generalize to real social cognition.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs perform poorly on tasks requiring grounding, such as emotional reasoning from images or social faux pas detection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.0" class="evidence-link">[e87.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.1" class="evidence-link">[e87.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-79.html#e79.0" class="evidence-link">[e79.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Models struggle to translate mental state inferences into appropriate actions in social contexts (e.g., T4D task). <a href="../results/extraction-result-77.html#e77.0" class="evidence-link">[e77.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-77.html#e77.1" class="evidence-link">[e77.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Benchmarks like FANToM show LLMs performing significantly worse than humans in multi-agent, information-asymmetric interactions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-84.html#e84.0" class="evidence-link">[e84.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs exhibit hallucinations and invalid actions in long-horizon social reasoning tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-82.html#e82.0" class="evidence-link">[e82.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Multimodal LLMs trained with visual and social context will outperform text-only models on ToM tasks requiring grounding.</li>
                <li>Interactive training with real-time social feedback will improve LLMs' ability to infer and act on mental states.</li>
                <li>LLMs without grounding will continue to fail tasks requiring implicit mental state inferences.</li>
                <li>Incorporating embodied or situated learning will enhance ToM capabilities beyond text-based training.</li>
                <li>Models trained on social interaction datasets will better handle deception and faux pas detection.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether grounding alone suffices to produce genuine ToM in LLMs is unknown.</li>
                <li>The extent to which multimodal and interactive training can close the gap with human ToM remains to be seen.</li>
                <li>Whether LLMs can integrate grounding with symbolic belief tracking effectively is uncertain.</li>
                <li>The potential for emergent ToM in future multimodal LLMs is unclear.</li>
                <li>Whether grounding can reduce hallucinations and improve robustness in ToM reasoning is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If text-only LLMs achieve human-level ToM on grounded tasks, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If multimodal or interactive training does not improve ToM capabilities, the importance of grounding would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If grounding does not reduce hallucinations or invalid actions, its benefits would be limited.</li>
                <li>If LLMs can translate mental state inferences into appropriate actions without grounding, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs trained on social interaction data fail to improve on deception detection, the theory would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show partial emotional reasoning capabilities with fine-tuning on narrative captions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.0" class="evidence-link">[e87.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.1" class="evidence-link">[e87.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Instruction tuning and prompting can partially compensate for lack of grounding in some tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.0" class="evidence-link">[e88.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.1" class="evidence-link">[e88.1]</a> </li>
