                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Optimization via Reflective Abstraction in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, through repeated generate-then-reflect cycles, abstract higher-level patterns from their own errors and corrections, leading to iterative self-optimization. The process involves not only fixing specific mistakes but also generalizing from them to form abstract rules or heuristics that guide future reasoning and answer generation.</p>
