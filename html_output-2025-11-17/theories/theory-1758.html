                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Interactive Prompting and Feedback Theory for Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that large language models (LLMs) can be used not only as passive detectors but as interactive agents that iteratively refine anomaly detection in lists through prompt engineering, user feedback, and self-reflection. The LLM's anomaly detection performance can be enhanced by structured prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and active querying, enabling detection of more subtle or context-dependent anomalies.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a user provides a prompt that explicitly asks the LLM to reason step-by-step about each item in a list, the LLM will detect more subtle anomalies than with a generic prompt.</li>
                <li>If the LLM is given feedback on its anomaly detection results, its subsequent outputs will better align with user expectations.</li>
                <li>Iterative prompting and feedback will lead to convergence on a set of anomalies that matches expert consensus more closely than single-pass LLM outputs.</li>
                <li>Structured prompts that include context or examples will outperform unstructured prompts in anomaly detection accuracy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the LLM is engaged in a multi-turn dialogue with a domain expert about a highly technical list, its anomaly detection accuracy may surpass that of traditional statistical methods.</li>
                <li>If the LLM is prompted to self-reflect and explain its anomaly detection decisions, it may uncover previously unrecognized types of anomalies.</li>
                <li>Repeated feedback cycles may lead to overfitting to user biases, potentially reducing generalizability of anomaly detection.</li>
                <li>Interactive prompting may enable LLMs to detect anomalies in data types (e.g., time series, graphs) where traditional LLMs struggle.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If interactive prompting and feedback do not improve anomaly detection accuracy over a single-pass approach, the theory's assumptions are challenged.</li>
                <li>If the LLM's performance degrades or becomes inconsistent with iterative prompting, the theory's predictions are undermined.</li>
                <li>If user feedback leads to worse anomaly detection (e.g., due to ambiguous or misleading feedback), the feedback-driven refinement law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to outperform simple statistical baselines even with structured prompting and feedback, the theory's impact is limited.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where user feedback is ambiguous or misleading, potentially causing the LLM to learn incorrect anomaly patterns. </li>
