                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that simulation fidelity requirements for training transferable scientific reasoning are determined by task-relevance rather than domain completeness. Specifically, high-fidelity simulation is only necessary for features and phenomena that are causally relevant to the reasoning task at hand, while task-irrelevant aspects can be simulated at low fidelity, approximated, or omitted entirely without compromising transfer performance. The theory suggests that there exists a task-specific subset of domain features that are sufficient for learning transferable reasoning, and that identifying and prioritizing fidelity for these features enables dramatic computational savings while maintaining or even improving transfer. This differs from traditional approaches that assume comprehensive high-fidelity simulation is always preferable.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For any scientific reasoning task T, there exists a subset of domain features F_T such that high-fidelity simulation of F_T is sufficient for learning transferable reasoning, regardless of the fidelity of features outside F_T.</li>
                <li>The task-relevant feature set F_T is determined by the causal structure of the reasoning task: features are task-relevant if and only if they participate in causal pathways that affect the task's target predictions.</li>
                <li>Simulation fidelity for task-irrelevant features can be reduced to minimal levels (or eliminated) without degrading transfer performance, and may actually improve transfer by reducing overfitting to spurious details.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of simulation can be reduced proportionally to the ratio |F_T|/|F_total|, where F_T is the task-relevant feature set and F_total is the complete domain feature set.</li>
                <li>Transfer success is maximized when simulation resources are allocated preferentially to task-relevant features, even if this means accepting lower fidelity or omissions in task-irrelevant features.</li>
                <li>For reasoning tasks that span multiple scales or abstraction levels, task-relevance must be evaluated at each level independently, and fidelity requirements may differ across levels.</li>
                <li>When task-relevant features emerge from interactions of lower-level features, those lower-level features become transitively task-relevant and require sufficient fidelity to produce correct emergent behavior.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Computational physics successfully uses different simulation methods at different scales (quantum mechanics for atoms, molecular dynamics for molecules, continuum mechanics for macroscopic objects), with each method omitting details irrelevant to its scale of prediction. </li>
    <li>Machine learning models trained on coarse-grained molecular simulations can predict protein behavior without requiring all-atom simulation detail, suggesting that many atomic-level details are not task-relevant for macroscopic property prediction. </li>
    <li>Circuit simulation tools use different abstraction levels (transistor-level, gate-level, behavioral) depending on the design task, with successful outcomes at each level, demonstrating that task-specific feature selection enables effective reasoning. </li>
    <li>Transfer learning research shows that models can successfully transfer when trained on simplified domains that preserve task-relevant structure, even when many domain details are abstracted away. </li>
    <li>Feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques in machine learning demonstrate that performance often improves when irrelevant features are removed, even if those features are accurate representations of reality. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An AI system learning to predict thermodynamic cycle efficiency (Carnot, Rankine, etc.) will transfer successfully from simulators that accurately model pressure, temperature, and volume relationships, even if molecular velocities, collision dynamics, and other microscopic details are omitted or highly simplified.</li>
                <li>Circuit design reasoning about digital logic timing will transfer from simulators that accurately model gate delays and signal propagation, without requiring accurate simulation of transistor-level current flows, semiconductor band structures, or quantum effects.</li>
                <li>Ecological reasoning about predator-prey population dynamics will transfer from Lotka-Volterra models that capture birth/death rates and interaction terms, without requiring accurate simulation of individual organism behavior, genetics, or detailed environmental factors.</li>
                <li>Chemical reaction equilibrium prediction will transfer from simulators using thermodynamic parameters (ΔG, ΔH, ΔS), without requiring quantum chemistry simulation of molecular orbitals or reaction mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Training on simplified simulators with high fidelity only for task-relevant features will produce faster training convergence and better generalization than training on comprehensive high-fidelity simulators that include many task-irrelevant details.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether reasoning systems can learn to automatically identify task-relevant features through meta-learning or attention mechanisms, or whether task-relevance must be specified by domain experts or discovered through systematic ablation studies.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist universal task-relevant features within scientific domains that support transfer across multiple reasoning tasks, or whether task-relevance is fundamentally task-specific with minimal overlap.</li>
                <li>The extent to which task-relevant features identified for simulation-based training correspond to the features that humans use for scientific reasoning in the same domain.</li>
                <li>Whether training on multiple tasks simultaneously with shared task-relevant features produces more efficient learning than training on each task independently with task-specific feature sets.</li>
                <li>Whether the theory's predictions hold for reasoning tasks that require creative hypothesis generation or scientific discovery, where the relevant features may not be known in advance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a system trained on simulators with high fidelity only for theoretically task-relevant features fails to transfer to real-world tasks, while a system trained on comprehensive high-fidelity simulation succeeds, this would challenge the sufficiency claim.</li>
                <li>If systematic removal of supposedly task-irrelevant features consistently degrades transfer performance, this would question the theory's ability to correctly identify task-relevant features.</li>
                <li>If the computational savings from reduced fidelity are offset by increased training time or sample complexity requirements, this would challenge the efficiency claims.</li>
                <li>If transfer performance shows a continuous degradation with reduced fidelity for supposedly task-irrelevant features rather than a sharp threshold, this would suggest task-relevance is not binary as the theory implies.</li>
                <li>If different reasoning tasks in the same domain require completely non-overlapping feature sets with no shared task-relevant features, this would challenge the practical utility of the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify algorithmic methods for identifying task-relevant features a priori, particularly for novel reasoning tasks where the causal structure is not well understood. </li>
    <li>The role of task-irrelevant features in providing robustness to distribution shift or novel scenarios is not addressed - these features may become relevant under different conditions. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for how to handle emergent phenomena where task-relevance cannot be determined by analyzing individual features in isolation, but only through their interactions. </li>
    <li>The relationship between task-relevant features for learning versus task-relevant features for explanation or interpretability is not specified - these may differ. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
