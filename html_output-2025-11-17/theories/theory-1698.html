                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Interactive Feedback Theory for LM-Guided Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models can iteratively improve anomaly detection in lists through interactive feedback: by incorporating user or system feedback on initial anomaly predictions, the LM can refine its internal representation of the list's regularities, leading to more accurate and context-sensitive anomaly detection.</p>
