                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic-Proteostatic Load Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that neuronal populations within the visual cortex that have higher metabolic rates and proteostatic demands are selectively more vulnerable to amyloid-β and tau pathology. The increased metabolic activity leads to greater production of reactive oxygen species and protein misfolding, while high proteostatic load strains the protein quality control systems, resulting in accumulation of toxic aggregates. Conversely, populations with lower metabolic and proteostatic demands are more resistant.</p>

                <li>Long-term reduction of metabolic rate in resistant populations will not further decrease their vulnerability, suggesting a threshold effect.</li>

                <li>Demonstrating that reducing metabolic rate does not alter vulnerability to aggregates in a given population would call the theory into question.</li>
