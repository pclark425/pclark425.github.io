                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory: Global Network Topology</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is fundamentally determined by their position and role within the global cortical network topology. Neurons with high network centrality, extensive long-range connectivity, and participation in integrative hubs are more susceptible to the propagation and accumulation of pathological proteins, while neurons embedded in highly modular, locally connected subnetworks are more resistant.</p>
