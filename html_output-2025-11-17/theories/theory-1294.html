                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1294</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Motif-Driven Locality Enhancement Theory for Hard Graph Problems (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that, for the purpose of converting graphs into text for language model training, representations that explicitly encode local graph motifs (i.e., small, recurring subgraph patterns) and their spatial or topological context enhance the learnability and generalization of hard graph problems by language models. The theory suggests that motif-centric representations provide a natural inductive bias, improving both the efficiency and accuracy of downstream reasoning tasks.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If motif-centric representations do not outperform baseline representations on hard graph problems, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If language models fail to generalize to graphs with similar motif distributions despite motif-centric encoding, the theory's generalization claim would be weakened.</li>
