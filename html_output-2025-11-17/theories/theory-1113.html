                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Threshold Theory (Interactional Generalization)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the emergence of strict logical reasoning in LLMs is not solely a function of model size, but results from a critical interaction between model scale, training data logical structure, and architectural inductive biases. Only when all three factors surpass their respective thresholds does robust logical reasoning emerge, suggesting a multi-dimensional threshold phenomenon.</p>
