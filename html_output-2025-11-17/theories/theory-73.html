                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cross-Domain Active Learning Efficiency Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how scientific procedural knowledge transfers across different experimental domains and contexts, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Active learning strategies transfer across domains with varying efficiency depending on: (1) uncertainty measure alignment (whether source-domain uncertainty correlates with target-domain informativeness), (2) class balance preservation (whether sampling maintains representative class distributions), (3) domain-specific informativeness criteria (whether what is informative in source remains informative in target), and (4) model calibration quality (whether uncertainty estimates are reliable). The theory predicts that uncertainty-based strategies transfer more reliably than diversity-based strategies when models are well-calibrated, that domain-specific adaptations (e.g., subsequence selection for sequences, attributed-source selection for tables) improve efficiency, and that active learning provides greatest benefit when annotation cost is high, domain shift is moderate, and model assumptions are not severely violated. The theory also predicts that active learning can underperform random sampling when: model misspecification is severe, computational overhead is high relative to annotation cost, or domain shift is extreme.</p>
