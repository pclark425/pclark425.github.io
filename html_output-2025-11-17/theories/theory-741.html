                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> As language models scale in size and training data, they begin to exhibit emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities for arithmetic, allowing them to generalize to novel problems and formats beyond memorized patterns. This emergent reasoning is not explicitly programmed but arises from the model's internal representations and training dynamics.</p>
