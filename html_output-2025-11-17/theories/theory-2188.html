                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most robust evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories arises from an iterative process in which automated systems and human experts co-evaluate, critique, and refine candidate theories. The theory asserts that feedback loops between AI and human evaluators improve both the quality of theories and the reliability of evaluation metrics.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The optimal number of iterations for maximal theory quality may depend on the complexity of the domain.</li>
