                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1842</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Signal Amplification Theory for LLM Discovery Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can forecast the probability of future scientific discoveries by amplifying weak contextual signals present in the scientific literature and discourse. By aggregating subtle cues—such as citation bursts, emerging terminology, and shifts in research focus—across vast corpora, LLMs can detect and quantify the likelihood of imminent breakthroughs. The theory emphasizes the LLM's ability to synthesize distributed, low-salience signals into actionable probabilistic forecasts.</p>

                <li>LLMs may be able to forecast the convergence of multiple weak signals into a major breakthrough event.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify false positives—topics with high salience but low actual discovery probability—revealing limitations of signal amplification.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to outperform baseline models in forecasting discoveries in fields with clear citation bursts, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot distinguish between genuine and spurious increases in contextual salience, the theory's mechanism is undermined.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the impact of non-textual signals (e.g., funding, patents) on discovery forecasting. </li>
    <li>The effect of deliberate hype or manipulation of salience signals is not considered. </li>
