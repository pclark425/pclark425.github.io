                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1582</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hypertube Navigation and Stability via Quantum Feedback Control</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory addresses the challenge of maintaining and navigating a hypertube for FTL travel by employing quantum feedback control systems. By continuously monitoring quantum signatures (e.g., entanglement, vacuum fluctuations) at the hypertube boundaries, active feedback can adjust the energy input and boundary conditions to stabilize the microbubble chain and steer the hypertube's trajectory. This enables dynamic course correction and prevents collapse or decoherence of the FTL conduit.</p>
