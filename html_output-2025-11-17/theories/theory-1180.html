                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Conditional Chemical Synthesis Theory (Specific: Application-Driven Scaffold Hopping)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, when conditioned on application-specific prompts (e.g., 'antiviral activity', 'photostability'), can perform scaffold hopping by generating novel core structures (scaffolds) that retain or enhance the desired functional properties, even when such scaffolds are underrepresented or absent in the training data. The LLM leverages its latent knowledge to propose new chemical backbones that satisfy the application constraints, enabling the discovery of structurally diverse solutions.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to generate molecules with novel scaffolds for specified properties in drug discovery tasks, as shown in recent benchmarks where LLMs generated active compounds with new core structures. </li>
    <li>Scaffold hopping is a known strategy in medicinal chemistry for overcoming intellectual property barriers and improving drug properties, but LLM-driven scaffold hopping is a new capability enabled by conditioning on application prompts. </li>
    <li>LLMs can generalize beyond their training data, as evidenced by their ability to generate valid, novel SMILES strings and chemical structures not present in the training set. </li>
    <li>Prompt engineering and conditioning have been shown to direct LLM outputs toward desired chemical properties, supporting the conditional aspect of scaffold generation. </li>
    <li>Some studies report that LLMs can propose molecules with predicted activity for targets where the training data is sparse, indicating the ability to extrapolate to new scaffolds. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While scaffold hopping and LLM-based molecule generation are known, the explicit conditional mechanism for application-driven scaffold hopping by LLMs is a new theoretical extension.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Scaffold hopping is established in medicinal chemistry; LLMs can generate novel molecules and have been used for property-driven molecule generation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law that LLMs can perform scaffold hopping conditioned on application prompts, even for underrepresented scaffolds, is novel and not previously formalized.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs prompted for a specific property (e.g., 'non-toxic antifungal') will generate molecules with novel scaffolds not present in the training set but predicted to have the desired property.</li>
                <li>Generated scaffolds will show structural diversity and property retention when compared to known actives for the same application.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning LLMs on property-specific data will further enhance their ability to perform scaffold hopping for that property.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely new classes of chemical scaffolds with superior properties for a given application, leading to breakthroughs in drug discovery or materials science.</li>
                <li>LLMs could propose scaffolds that are synthetically accessible but have never been synthesized or reported in the literature.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify scaffold-property relationships that are not apparent to human chemists, leading to unexpected structure-activity relationships.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate novel scaffolds for application-specific prompts, the conditional scaffold hopping law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If generated scaffolds do not retain the desired property, the theory's predictive power is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only reproduce known scaffolds from the training data regardless of prompt, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain the mechanism by which LLMs assess synthetic accessibility of novel scaffolds. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address the potential for LLMs to generate chemically unstable or non-viable scaffolds. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends scaffold hopping to the LLM-driven, application-conditioned context, which is new and not previously formalized.</p>
