                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory: General Bottleneck Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that language models (LMs) face a fundamental bottleneck at the interface between neural (sub-symbolic) and symbolic representations, which limits their ability to perform strict logical reasoning. The bottleneck arises because neural architectures excel at distributed, continuous representations, while strict logic requires manipulation of discrete, explicit symbols and rules. This mismatch leads to systematic failures in tasks demanding precise logical inference, especially as complexity increases.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Somewhat related to existing work on compositionality, but the explicit bottleneck framing is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that neural models struggle with compositional generalization and deep reasoning.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law ties the performance drop directly to the neuro-symbolic interface bottleneck and logical complexity.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It may be possible to train LLMs to internally develop quasi-symbolic representations that partially overcome the bottleneck.</li>
                <li>There may exist architectures that can dynamically switch between neural and symbolic modes, reducing the bottleneck.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a pure neural LM achieves high accuracy on arbitrarily complex logical tasks without explicit symbolic modules, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If error rates do not increase with logical complexity, the bottleneck hypothesis would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs can solve certain logic puzzles with few steps, suggesting the bottleneck is not absolute. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
