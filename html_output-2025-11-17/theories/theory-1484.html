                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the position of a concept's representation on the modal–amodal continuum is not fixed, but is dynamically modulated by contextual factors such as task demands, recent experience, and individual differences. The brain flexibly shifts the representational format of a concept toward more modal or more amodal instantiations as needed, allowing for adaptive conceptual processing across diverse situations.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Pharmacological modulation of attention or working memory will alter the flexibility of continuum shifting.</li>
                <li>In bilinguals, the language of presentation will modulate the position on the continuum for culturally grounded concepts.</li>
                <li>Developmental changes (e.g., in children) will show a shift from modal to more amodal representations with age and education.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If representational format is invariant to context or individual differences, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If no neural or behavioral evidence of shifting is found, the continuum model would be undermined.</li>
