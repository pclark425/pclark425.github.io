                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models, when sufficiently large and trained on diverse data, can develop emergent internal representations that approximate algorithmic reasoning for arithmetic. This enables them to perform arithmetic operations by simulating stepwise procedures, such as addition with carrying, even in cases not explicitly seen during training.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>There may be a threshold model size or data diversity beyond which algorithmic reasoning for arithmetic reliably emerges.</li>
                <li>Models trained on synthetic data with explicit stepwise solutions may develop more robust algorithmic representations.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If even very large models cannot generalize to longer arithmetic problems, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If probing fails to reveal any stepwise or algorithmic structure in model activations, the theory would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some small models show limited arithmetic ability, possibly due to memorization rather than algorithmic reasoning. </li>
