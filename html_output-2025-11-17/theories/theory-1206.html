                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1206</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representation Robustness and Expressivity Theory for LLM Chemical Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of LLMs to synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications depends on the robustness and expressivity of their internal chemical representations. Robustness refers to the model's capacity to generalize across chemical space and resist adversarial or out-of-distribution perturbations, while expressivity refers to the richness and flexibility of the representations to encode diverse chemical structures and properties. The interplay between these two factors determines the LLM's capacity for creative, reliable, and application-driven chemical synthesis.</p>
