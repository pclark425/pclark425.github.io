                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-Process Coupling Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that the quality, creativity, and reliability of scientific theories generated by large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally shaped by the nature and structure of the coupling between the LLM's generative process and the human (or automated) evaluator's intervention. The theory asserts that the timing, modality, and feedback loop characteristics of evaluator involvement systematically influence the trajectory and final quality of LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-generated scientific theories will be more accurate and creative when evaluators are tightly integrated into the generative process.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be an optimal level of coupling beyond which further integration of evaluators and LLMs leads to diminishing or negative returns.</li>
                <li>Certain scientific domains may benefit more from specific feedback modalities (e.g., visual feedback in chemistry, code in computational biology).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If loose or post-hoc evaluation produces theories of equal or higher quality than tightly coupled evaluation, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If unimodal feedback (e.g., only text) consistently outperforms multimodal feedback, the feedback modality law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs with advanced self-evaluation or self-correction capabilities may reduce the need for tight evaluator coupling. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
