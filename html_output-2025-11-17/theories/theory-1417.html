                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through generate-then-reflect cycles by iteratively aligning their outputs with internalized representations of correctness, coherence, and task goals. Each reflection step acts as a self-supervised feedback loop, where the model uses its own prior outputs and internal standards to guide subsequent revisions, leading to convergence toward higher-quality answers.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing the number of generate-then-reflect cycles will improve answer quality up to a point, after which further cycles yield little or no improvement.</li>

                <li>Prompting the model with explicit standards (e.g., 'be more concise') will shift the convergence point of answer quality.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained with explicit self-reflection objectives, the rate and quality of convergence may improve.</li>
                <li>Introducing external feedback (e.g., human-in-the-loop) during reflection may override or reshape the model's internal optimum.</li>
                <li>Models with more diverse or richer training data may develop more robust internal standards, leading to higher-quality convergence.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If answer quality does not improve or converge with repeated reflection cycles, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If models do not use internalized standards during reflection (e.g., random changes), the self-supervised feedback loop law is invalid.</li>
                <li>If external feedback consistently overrides model's internal convergence, the theory's sufficiency is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection cycles lead to oscillation or divergence rather than convergence. </li>
    <li>Instances where the model's internal standards are poorly aligned with human expectations. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory is new in the context of LLMs and in-context self-reflection, though related to iterative optimization and self-consistency.</p>
