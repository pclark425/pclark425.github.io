                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Action Space Pruning via Knowledge Graph Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about navigation complexity in text worlds that relates graph-topology features (diameter, clustering, dead-ends, door constraints) to exploration efficiency and optimal policy structure.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that agents can construct a knowledge graph representation of text-world environments that encodes not just spatial topology but also semantic relationships between locations, objects, and actions. By reasoning over this knowledge graph, agents can prune actions from consideration based on: (1) precondition violations (actions requiring objects/states not currently accessible), (2) semantic impossibility (actions incompatible with current location type), (3) diameter-bounded path constraints (paths exceeding estimated graph diameter), and (4) clustering-based locality (actions leading to regions with low clustering coefficient when goal is in high-clustering regions). The theory predicts that knowledge graph-based pruning can reduce the effective action space by 50-70% in complex text worlds while maintaining optimality, with pruning effectiveness scaling with environment complexity (measured by number of object types, door constraints, and semantic relationships).</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An agent can construct a knowledge graph G_K = (V, E, R, T) where V represents locations and objects, E represents spatial connections, R represents semantic relationships (contains, requires, unlocks), and T represents type information (room types, object types).</li>
                <li>Action pruning can be performed at multiple levels: (1) Type-level pruning eliminates actions semantically incompatible with current location type (e.g., 'swim' in a desert location), (2) Precondition pruning eliminates actions whose preconditions are not satisfied (e.g., 'unlock door' without key), (3) Diameter-bounded pruning eliminates paths exceeding estimated graph diameter D, (4) Clustering-based pruning deprioritizes actions leading to low-clustering regions when goal is likely in high-clustering regions.</li>
                <li>The effective action space reduction R_eff is multiplicative across pruning levels: R_eff = R_type × R_precond × R_diameter × R_cluster, where each R_i ∈ [0,1] represents the fraction of actions remaining after that pruning level.</li>
                <li>Type-level pruning provides constant-time O(1) action filtering and typically eliminates 20-40% of actions in semantically rich environments with ≥5 distinct location types.</li>
                <li>Precondition pruning requires maintaining an inventory/state representation and eliminates 30-50% of actions in environments with complex object dependencies (≥10 object types with precondition constraints).</li>
                <li>Diameter-bounded pruning becomes effective when D > 20 and eliminates 15-30% of redundant exploration paths by preventing sequences exceeding D steps from any visited location.</li>
                <li>Clustering-based pruning is most effective in environments with heterogeneous clustering (coefficient variance > 0.3) and can reduce exploration in low-value regions by 25-40%.</li>
                <li>The knowledge graph can be learned online through interaction, with semantic relationships inferred from observation patterns (e.g., if 'unlock' action consistently requires 'key' object, this precondition is added to G_K).</li>
                <li>Combined multi-level pruning achieves 50-70% action space reduction in complex environments (>50 locations, >10 object types, >5 door constraints) while maintaining optimality with probability >0.95.</li>
                <li>The computational overhead of knowledge graph maintenance and pruning queries is O(|A| × log|V|) per decision step, where |A| is the action space size and |V| is the number of nodes in the knowledge graph.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Knowledge graphs can represent structured relationships between entities, enabling reasoning about preconditions and action feasibility. </li>
    <li>Text-based games have structured state spaces with semantic constraints on valid actions based on object properties and locations. </li>
    <li>Graph diameter provides upper bounds on shortest path lengths, enabling pruning of unnecessarily long action sequences. </li>
    <li>Clustering coefficient indicates local connectivity and can inform navigation strategies in graph-structured environments. </li>
    <li>Action preconditions in planning domains can be used to prune infeasible actions, reducing search space. </li>
    <li>Semantic type constraints can eliminate invalid actions in structured environments. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In text worlds with rich semantic structure (≥8 location types, ≥15 object types), agents using knowledge graph-based action pruning will reach goals 40-60% faster than agents without pruning, measured in number of actions taken.</li>
                <li>The knowledge graph will converge to accurate precondition models within 100-200 interactions in environments with consistent rules, achieving >90% accuracy in predicting action feasibility.</li>
                <li>Agents will naturally discover hierarchical structure in the knowledge graph, with high-level location clusters (e.g., 'indoor' vs 'outdoor', 'residential' vs 'commercial') emerging from clustering analysis.</li>
                <li>In environments with door constraints, precondition-based pruning will show the largest individual contribution to efficiency gains (30-40% reduction), followed by type-level pruning (20-30%), then diameter-bounded pruning (15-25%).</li>
                <li>The variance in exploration efficiency across different random seeds will decrease by 40-50% when using knowledge graph pruning, as semantic constraints prevent many suboptimal exploration patterns.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If knowledge graphs are augmented with learned embeddings that capture latent semantic relationships, pruning effectiveness might increase to 70-85% reduction, but the sample complexity of learning accurate embeddings in sparse-reward environments is unclear.</li>
                <li>Combining knowledge graph pruning with hierarchical reinforcement learning might enable multi-scale action abstraction where entire action sequences are pruned at once, potentially achieving near-optimal exploration with 80-90% fewer primitive actions, but the complexity of maintaining consistent abstractions across hierarchy levels is unknown.</li>
                <li>In adversarial or non-stationary environments where semantic rules change over time, knowledge graph-based pruning might lead to catastrophic failures if the agent over-commits to learned preconditions that become invalid, requiring meta-learning or uncertainty quantification mechanisms that may be computationally prohibitive.</li>
                <li>Transfer learning of knowledge graphs across related text worlds might enable zero-shot or few-shot pruning in new environments, potentially reducing initial exploration by 60-80%, but the conditions under which knowledge graphs transfer successfully versus fail catastrophically are not well understood.</li>
                <li>If knowledge graphs incorporate probabilistic reasoning over uncertain preconditions and relationships, adaptive pruning thresholds based on confidence levels might balance exploration and exploitation more effectively, but the optimal confidence thresholds and their relationship to environment properties are unclear.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If knowledge graph construction and maintenance requires >25% of total computation time, the practical benefits of pruning would be questionable despite theoretical action space reduction.</li>
                <li>If learned preconditions have >20% false positive rate (incorrectly pruning valid actions), this would lead to suboptimality and contradict the theory's claims about maintaining optimality.</li>
                <li>If environments with rich semantic structure (>10 object types) show no greater benefit from knowledge graph pruning than simple environments (<5 object types), this would challenge the theory's scalability predictions.</li>
                <li>If the knowledge graph fails to converge to accurate models within 500 interactions in environments with consistent rules, this would suggest the learning approach is fundamentally flawed.</li>
                <li>If combined multi-level pruning achieves <30% action space reduction in complex environments, this would indicate the pruning levels are not as effective as predicted or do not combine multiplicatively.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to handle contradictory or noisy observations when learning semantic relationships in stochastic environments. </li>
    <li>The interaction between knowledge graph pruning and exploration bonuses (curiosity-driven exploration) is not characterized - aggressive pruning might eliminate novel states that would receive high exploration bonuses. </li>
    <li>The theory assumes semantic relationships are learnable from observation, but some relationships might require explicit instruction or cannot be inferred from interaction patterns alone. </li>
    <li>How to handle partial observability where the agent cannot observe all relevant state information for accurate precondition checking is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
