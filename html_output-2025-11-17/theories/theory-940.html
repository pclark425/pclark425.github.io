                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Structure-Dependent Memory Utility Law for LLM Agents (General Theory 1)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the utility of memory for LLM agents in text games is fundamentally determined by the structure of the task, such that the optimal memory strategy (e.g., what to store, how to retrieve, and when to update) is a function of the dependencies and temporal relationships inherent in the task's design. The theory asserts that memory is most beneficial when the task requires integrating information across temporally or spatially distant events, and less so when the task is locally Markovian or can be solved with short-term context.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Tasks requiring the agent to recall information from earlier in the game (e.g., locations of objects, prior events) are solved more efficiently when memory is available. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show LLM agents perform better on tasks with delayed rewards or dependencies when equipped with memory modules. </li>
    <li>In text-based games like Zork, agents must remember clues or object locations encountered many steps earlier to solve puzzles. </li>
    <li>Memory-augmented neural networks outperform vanilla LLMs on tasks with partial observability and long-term dependencies. </li>

    <li>Different text games (e.g., puzzle, exploration, social interaction) require different memory strategies for optimal performance. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM agents with memory do not outperform stateless agents on tasks with long-range dependencies, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If customizing memory strategies to task structure does not yield performance gains over generic strategies, the theory would be undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of memory on agent creativity or exploration in open-ended text games is not addressed. </li>
