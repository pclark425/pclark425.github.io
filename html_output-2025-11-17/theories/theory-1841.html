                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented and Ensemble Reasoning Theory (RAERT) of LLM Scientific Discovery Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can accurately estimate the probability of future real-world scientific discoveries by leveraging retrieval-augmented mechanisms and ensemble reasoning. The LLM integrates up-to-date external knowledge (retrieval) with its internal representations and simulates multiple reasoning paths (ensemble) to generate probabilistic forecasts. The accuracy of these forecasts is determined by the diversity, recency, and relevance of the retrieved information, as well as the model's ability to synthesize and weigh competing hypotheses.</p>
