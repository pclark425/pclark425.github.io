                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2374</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Propagation and Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective vulnerability in the visual cortex is governed by the patterns of neuronal activity and connectivity that facilitate the trans-synaptic spread of pathological amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau species. Neurons with high-frequency firing, long-range, or hub-like connectivity are more likely to accumulate pathology due to increased exposure to propagating toxic species, while neurons with local, low-frequency, or inhibitory connectivity are more resistant. The theory integrates evidence from trans-synaptic propagation models, activity-dependent tau/Aβ release, and the observed sparing of inhibitory and local circuit neurons.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Experimental models show that increased neuronal activity accelerates tau and Aβ spread. </li>
    <li>Hub neurons and long-range projection neurons are early sites of pathology in AD models. </li>
    <li>Trans-synaptic spread of tau and Aβ is facilitated by synaptic activity and connectivity. </li>
    <li>Visual cortex projection neurons with high activity show earlier and more severe pathology in animal models. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The general principle is established, but its explicit application to visual cortex selectivity and formalization as a conditional law is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Activity-dependent propagation of tau and Aβ has been demonstrated in animal models, and hub/long-range projection neurons are known to be early sites of pathology.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law applies the principle specifically to visual cortex populations, and formalizes the link between activity/connectivity and selective vulnerability.</p>

                <li>Observing that inhibitory, local circuit neurons develop pathology at the same rate as excitatory, long-range neurons would call the theory into question.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that activity manipulation has no effect on pathology spread in visual cortex would refute the theory.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some projection neurons may be resistant despite high activity, possibly due to unknown protective factors such as gene expression or local microenvironment. </li>
