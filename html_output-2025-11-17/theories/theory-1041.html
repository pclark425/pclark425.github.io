                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs solve spatial puzzle games by simulating possible puzzle states as sequences of tokens, leveraging their autoregressive architecture to explore, evaluate, and select valid moves, effectively performing a form of sequential spatial simulation and search within the constraints of their context window.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the context window is artificially shortened, LLM performance on spatial puzzles will degrade sharply.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are prompted to generate multiple solution paths, they will tend to avoid repeating invalid or redundant sequences.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are given explicit step-by-step prompts, their spatial puzzle performance will improve.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit search tree representations, their spatial puzzle performance may improve or become more interpretable.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are given puzzles with ambiguous or multiple valid solutions, their output distribution may reflect a search over possible token sequences.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are fine-tuned on spatial puzzles with explicit feedback, their internal simulation mechanisms may become more efficient.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs can solve spatial puzzles with context windows too small to encode the full state, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs frequently repeat invalid or redundant moves in generated solutions, the theory's claim of implicit pruning is weakened.</li>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well regardless of prompt structure (stepwise vs. all-at-once), the theory's sequential simulation claim is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain how LLMs handle puzzles requiring global, non-sequential reasoning. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
