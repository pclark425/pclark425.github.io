                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memory Condensation and Validation are Essential for Effective Use of Episodic Experience in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Due to the limited context window and the need for actionable, generalizable knowledge, LLM agents for text games benefit most from memory that is (1) condensed (summarized, distilled, or abstracted from raw experience), (2) validated (checked for correctness and relevance), and (3) dynamically updated (via reflection, tip synthesis, or self-verification). Raw, verbose trajectory replay is less effective and can even be detrimental due to context overflow and information dilution.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Introspective tips and self-reflection outperform raw trajectory replay due to context window limits and improved generalization; raw replay is limited by input length and less actionable. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3031.html#e3031.0" class="evidence-link">[e3031.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3245.html#e3245.0" class="evidence-link">[e3245.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3245.html#e3245.1" class="evidence-link">[e3245.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3031.html#e3031.1" class="evidence-link">[e3031.1]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>On a new text game, an agent using introspective tips or self-reflection will learn to solve the game in fewer trials than an agent using raw trajectory replay, given the same context window.</li>
                <li>Aggregating and validating tips across multiple related games will enable an agent to achieve high zero-shot performance on a new, harder game in the same domain.</li>
                <li>If the context window is increased, the benefit of condensation may decrease, but condensed memory will still outperform raw replay for generalization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the condensed tips or reflections are generated automatically (without human validation), the agent may still outperform raw replay, but the risk of invalid or misleading tips increases; the net effect is unknown.</li>
                <li>In highly novel or adversarial games, the effectiveness of aggregated tips from other domains is uncertain and may depend on the abstraction level of the tips.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an agent using raw trajectory replay outperforms one using condensed tips or reflections on a suite of text games, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If context window is not a limiting factor (e.g., with infinite context), and raw replay still underperforms, the theory's explanation would need revision.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some failure cases occur when tips are not sufficiently general or miss corner cases, leading to underperformance on easy levels. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3031.html#e3031.0" class="evidence-link">[e3031.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In tasks requiring highly specific, step-by-step recall (e.g., puzzles with unique solutions), raw trajectory replay may be necessary. </li>
