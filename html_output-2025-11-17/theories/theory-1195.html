                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when trained on diverse chemical representations (e.g., SMILES, InChI, reaction text), develop emergent internal representations that allow them to traverse and generate novel regions of chemical space. These representations are not explicitly programmed but arise from the model's exposure to vast chemical corpora, enabling the synthesis of novel chemicals tailored to specific applications through prompt engineering and latent space manipulation.</p>
