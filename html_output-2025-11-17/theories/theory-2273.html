                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluation Integrity and Contamination Theory (General Framework)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the integrity of evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories is fundamentally determined by the interplay between evaluator independence, protocol transparency, and contamination risk. It provides a high-level framework for understanding how contamination (intentional or unintentional) can arise and propagate, and how evaluation systems can be designed to maximize integrity.</p>
