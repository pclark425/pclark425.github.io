                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Synthesis Theory (IRAST)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective and reliable distillation of scientific theories from large numbers of scholarly papers by LLMs is achieved through an iterative, retrieval-augmented synthesis process. In this process, LLMs alternate between retrieving relevant evidence from a curated corpus and generating candidate syntheses, with each generation step conditioned on both retrieved evidence and prior outputs. Confidence estimation and multi-agent or ensemble mechanisms are used to refine outputs, reduce hallucination, and ensure factual grounding. The process is further enhanced by domain-adaptive pretraining and mission-focused instruction tuning, which align the LLM's internal representations with the structure and semantics of the target scientific domain.</p>

    <li>Ablation studies show that domain-only trained LLMs (e.g., from-scratch neuroscience LLM) can achieve superhuman performance on domain benchmarks, supporting the importance of domain alignment. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6008.html#e6008.7" class="evidence-link">[e6008.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6058.html#e6058.2" class="evidence-link">[e6058.2]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is iteratively prompted with retrieval-augmented evidence and confidence-based refinement, it will produce more accurate and less hallucinated syntheses than single-pass or non-retrieval approaches, even in new scientific domains.</li>
                <li>LLMs that are both domain-pretrained and mission-focused instruction-tuned will outperform generalist LLMs or those with only one of these adaptations on new, unseen theory distillation tasks.</li>
                <li>In high-stakes domains (e.g., medicine), iterative retrieval-augmented LLMs will yield higher recall and accuracy in evidence synthesis than naive prompting or single-pass summarization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying iterative retrieval-augmented synthesis with multi-agent debate or ensemble mechanisms will further reduce hallucination and may enable the discovery of genuinely novel scientific theories not present in the training data.</li>
                <li>Combining domain-adaptive pretraining with real-time retrieval from up-to-date corpora will allow LLMs to synthesize cutting-edge theories that surpass current human expert consensus.</li>
                <li>If retrieval-augmented, domain-adapted LLMs are applied to highly interdisciplinary corpora, they may generate cross-domain syntheses or hypotheses not previously recognized by human experts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM using iterative retrieval-augmented synthesis fails to outperform single-pass or non-retrieval LLMs on factuality and accuracy in theory distillation, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If domain-adaptive pretraining and mission-focused tuning do not yield measurable improvements in theory distillation accuracy or robustness over generic instruction tuning, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If ensemble or multi-agent mechanisms do not reduce hallucination rates compared to single-agent iterative retrieval-augmented synthesis, the ensemble aspect of the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some evidence suggests that even with retrieval-augmentation, LLMs can still hallucinate or misattribute facts, especially when retrieval quality is poor or context windows are exceeded. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6076.html#e6076.2" class="evidence-link">[e6076.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6015.html#e6015.1" class="evidence-link">[e6015.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6003.html#e6003.1" class="evidence-link">[e6003.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6022.html#e6022.4" class="evidence-link">[e6022.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6081.html#e6081.5" class="evidence-link">[e6081.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Certain tasks (e.g., highly mathematical or symbolic reasoning) may not benefit as much from retrieval-augmentation or domain-adaptive pretraining, as seen in AlphaGeometry and Minerva. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6003.html#e6003.3" class="evidence-link">[e6003.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6060.html#e6060.2" class="evidence-link">[e6060.2]</a> </li>
    <li>In some molecule prediction tasks, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) underperformed simple few-shot prompting, suggesting that retrieval-augmentation is not universally superior. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6026.html#e6026.1" class="evidence-link">[e6026.1]</a> </li>
