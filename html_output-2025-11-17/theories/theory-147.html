                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Aligned Abstraction Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> An optimal world model should encode information at the level of abstraction that matches the task's decision-making requirements, rather than maximizing raw observational fidelity. Models that reconstruct all observable details (including task-irrelevant features) waste representational capacity and computational resources, leading to worse task performance than models that selectively encode task-relevant features. The optimal abstraction level varies by domain: semantic/symbolic for high-level planning (e.g., causal graphs, BEV representations), geometric for spatial reasoning (e.g., pose representations), and pixel-level only when fine visual details directly impact decisions. This principle applies across model types, from latent dynamics models to value-based planners, and the benefits manifest as improved sample efficiency, computational efficiency, robustness to distractors, and task performance.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>World model fidelity should be measured by task-relevant prediction accuracy (reward, value, policy-relevant state features) rather than observational reconstruction error (pixel MSE, full-state likelihood)</li>
                <li>The optimal representation dimensionality is the minimum sufficient to capture task-critical dynamics, with excess capacity allocated to task-irrelevant features degrading sample efficiency and generalization</li>
                <li>Pixel-level reconstruction is only optimal when fine visual details directly determine optimal actions; for most control tasks, semantic, geometric, or value-based abstractions are superior</li>
                <li>Semantic or geometric abstractions (BEV, object poses, causal graphs) outperform pixel models when tasks involve spatial reasoning, object interactions, or long-horizon planning</li>
                <li>Models that encode task-irrelevant features exhibit worse sample efficiency, higher computational cost, and reduced robustness to visual distractors compared to task-aligned models</li>
                <li>The computational cost of world models should be allocated proportionally to the task-relevance of predicted quantities, with task-critical predictions receiving more capacity than auxiliary details</li>
                <li>Task-aligned abstractions enable more efficient planning by reducing the search space and focusing computational resources on decision-relevant dimensions</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>In robotic manipulation tasks, world models that explicitly represent object poses, contact points, and force interactions will achieve 3-10x better sample efficiency than pixel-based models of equivalent parameter count</li>
                <li>For navigation tasks, world models using topological or graph-based representations will require 50-80% less data to achieve competent performance than dense spatial models, particularly in large-scale environments</li>
                <li>Multi-task world models that learn task-specific encoding heads while sharing a common backbone will outperform both fully-shared and fully-separate models, achieving better average performance across tasks</li>
                <li>World models that predict value-relevant features (as in MuZero) will show better scaling with search depth than observation-reconstruction models in planning-intensive domains</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether a single world model can dynamically adjust its abstraction level based on task requirements (e.g., switching between pixel, semantic, and symbolic representations), or if task-specific models are necessary for optimal performance</li>
                <li>Whether there exists a universal, learnable metric for 'task-relevance' that can be computed without task-specific supervision, possibly through meta-learning or information-theoretic objectives</li>
                <li>If multi-task world models can learn to automatically route different tasks to appropriate abstraction levels (e.g., via mixture-of-experts or hierarchical architectures) without explicit architectural design</li>
                <li>Whether task-aligned abstractions transfer better across domains than pixel-level representations, or if the specificity of task-alignment reduces transfer capability</li>
                <li>How the optimal abstraction level changes during learning: whether exploration phases benefit from higher-fidelity representations while exploitation phases benefit from task-aligned abstractions</li>
                <li>Whether task-aligned world models can discover novel task-relevant features that weren't explicitly specified in the task definition, potentially enabling better generalization to related tasks</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding tasks where pixel-perfect reconstruction consistently outperforms task-aligned abstractions across multiple model architectures and training regimes would challenge the generality of this theory</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that models with higher observational fidelity (measured by reconstruction error) consistently achieve better task performance across diverse domains, even when controlling for model capacity, would contradict the theory</li>
                <li>Showing that task-irrelevant features systematically improve generalization to novel scenarios or out-of-distribution states would question the selective encoding principle</li>
                <li>Finding that the computational cost of determining task-relevance exceeds the savings from task-aligned representations would challenge the practical utility of the principle</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that task-aligned models fail catastrophically when task requirements change slightly, while reconstruction-based models adapt smoothly, would suggest reconstruction provides valuable robustness</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact mechanism for determining task-relevance without extensive task-specific training or supervision is unclear; current methods rely on task rewards or hand-designed objectives <a href="../results/extraction-result-1244.html#e1244.0" class="evidence-link">[e1244.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1263.html#e1263.0" class="evidence-link">[e1263.0]</a> </li>
    <li>How to handle tasks where relevance changes dynamically or is context-dependent (e.g., multi-phase tasks, tasks with changing objectives) <a href="../results/extraction-result-1225.html#e1225.0" class="evidence-link">[e1225.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The relationship between abstraction level and transfer learning capability is not fully characterized; it's unclear whether task-specific abstractions help or hurt transfer <a href="../results/extraction-result-1413.html#e1413.3" class="evidence-link">[e1413.3]</a> </li>
    <li>How to balance task-alignment with the need for exploration and discovery of novel task-relevant features not specified a priori <a href="../results/extraction-result-1255.html#e1255.0" class="evidence-link">[e1255.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of model capacity and architecture in determining whether task-alignment benefits outweigh reconstruction benefits; some evidence suggests larger models can afford both <a href="../results/extraction-result-1244.html#e1244.1" class="evidence-link">[e1244.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1416.html#e1416.3" class="evidence-link">[e1416.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Whether there are fundamental limits to task-aligned compression (e.g., information-theoretic bounds) that determine when reconstruction becomes necessary </li>
