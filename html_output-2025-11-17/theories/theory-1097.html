                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory (Cognitive Constraints Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the neuro-symbolic interface bottleneck in language models is fundamentally rooted in cognitive constraints analogous to those observed in human reasoning. Specifically, it posits that the distributed representations in neural models mirror the limitations of human working memory and chunking, which restrict the ability to maintain and manipulate explicit symbolic structures over multiple reasoning steps, thereby limiting strict logical reasoning.</p>

                <li>There may exist neural architectures that can dynamically allocate memory resources to symbolic elements, partially overcoming the bottleneck.</li>
                <li>Hybrid models that mimic human cognitive strategies (e.g., rehearsal, externalization) may show non-linear improvements in logical reasoning.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs can maintain and manipulate a large number of distinct symbolic elements over many reasoning steps without error, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If increasing model size or context window does not improve multi-step logical reasoning, the analogy to working memory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If chunking-based training does not affect logical reasoning performance, the chunking limitation law would be falsified.</li>
