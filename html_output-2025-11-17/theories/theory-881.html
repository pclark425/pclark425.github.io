                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Reflective-Abstractive Memory Architecture for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve scalable, coherent long-term memory by organizing memories in a hierarchical structure, where lower levels store detailed episodic traces, intermediate levels store reflective evaluations, and higher levels store abstractive, generalized schemas. Reflective processes operate at each level to select, promote, or prune memories, while abstractive processes synthesize higher-level representations. This architecture enables efficient retrieval, flexible generalization, and robust adaptation to new tasks.</p>
