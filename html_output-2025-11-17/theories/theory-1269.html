                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structural Inductive Bias and Modality Adaptation Theory: General Law of Modality Adaptation Pressure</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the process of converting graphs into text for language model training is subject to a modality adaptation pressure, wherein the representation must balance the preservation of graph-specific information with the constraints and affordances of the text modality. The optimal representation is one that maximizes the transfer of graph semantics while minimizing information loss and cognitive overload for the language model.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Representations that are too verbose or too compressed both lead to degraded model performance. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that balancing explicitness (e.g., edge labels) and conciseness (e.g., omitting redundant nodes) yields better results. </li>
    <li>Overly complex representations can exceed the model's context window or overwhelm its capacity. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law generalizes empirical findings into a formal principle of modality adaptation, emphasizing the trade-off between information preservation and model constraints.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Best practices for balancing explicitness and conciseness in graph-to-text conversion are known, but not formalized as a law.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the trade-off as a modality adaptation pressure, predicting an optimal point of semantic transfer.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>For future language models with much larger context windows, the optimal explicitness/conciseness trade-off may shift.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If models perform best with either maximal explicitness or maximal compression, the law would be challenged.</li>
