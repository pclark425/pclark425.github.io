                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications through an iterative process that alternates between language-based reasoning and structure-based evaluation. The LLM generates candidate molecules based on application prompts, evaluates or simulates their properties (internally or via external models), and refines its outputs through feedback, effectively performing a closed-loop optimization in chemical space.</p>
