                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration in Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically integrating episodic (task-specific, contextual) and semantic (general, abstracted) memory representations. The agent's memory system should flexibly balance retrieval and storage between these two types, using episodic memory for context-sensitive reasoning and semantic memory for generalization, with adaptive mechanisms to transfer knowledge between them as needed.</p>
