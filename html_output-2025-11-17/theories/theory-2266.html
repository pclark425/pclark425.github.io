                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most robust evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories arises from an iterative process in which automated systems and human experts alternate in critiquing, refining, and scoring theories. Each round of evaluation incorporates feedback from both parties, leading to convergence on higher-quality, more reliable scientific theories.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal number of iterations for convergence on theory quality is unknown and may vary by domain.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative human-AI evaluation does not improve theory quality over single-pass evaluation, the convergence law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If human and AI feedback consistently diverge without convergence, the alternating critique law is flawed.</li>
