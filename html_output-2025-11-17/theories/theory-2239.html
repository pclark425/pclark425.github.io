                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2239</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional, Task-Aligned, and Calibration-Aware Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must be multidimensional, explicitly aligned to the intended scientific task, and sensitive to the calibration of the LLM's confidence. It asserts that no single evaluation metric or rubric suffices; instead, a composite, context-aware approach is required. The theory further claims that the evaluation process must dynamically integrate dimensions such as factual accuracy, logical coherence, novelty, task relevance, and model calibration, with the weighting of each dimension determined by the scientific context and risk profile.</p>

                <li>If calibration-aware evaluation does not improve the identification of reliable theories in high-risk domains, the theory's necessity is called into question.</li>
