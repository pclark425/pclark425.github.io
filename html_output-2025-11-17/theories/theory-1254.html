                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Fidelity Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for language model training is one that maximizes semantic fidelity: the preservation and explicit encoding of all graph semantics (nodes, edges, attributes, and higher-order structures) in a form that is both interpretable and compositional for language models. The theory asserts that representations which maintain explicit, lossless mappings between graph elements and their textual counterparts enable language models to learn graph-structured reasoning and generalize to unseen graph types.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that language models trained on explicit, lossless graph-to-text representations (e.g., linearized triples, serialized adjacency lists) can perform graph reasoning and answer questions about graph structure. </li>
    <li>Lossy or ambiguous representations (e.g., natural language summaries) lead to degraded performance on graph-structured tasks. </li>
    <li>Explicit serialization of knowledge graphs (e.g., in triple format) is standard in knowledge graph-to-text and text-to-graph tasks, and is shown to improve downstream performance. </li>
    <li>AMR-to-text and text-to-AMR tasks demonstrate that lossless, explicit representations enable better semantic parsing and generation. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to prior work on graph serialization and knowledge graph-to-text, the explicit semantic fidelity principle as a universal requirement is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Existing work has shown that explicit representations (e.g., triple-based, serialized) improve graph-to-text and text-to-graph tasks.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit claim that semantic fidelity (lossless, explicit encoding of all graph elements) is both necessary and sufficient for ideal language model training is novel.</p>
