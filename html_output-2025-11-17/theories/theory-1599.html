                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1599</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain-Alignment Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the primary determinant of LLM accuracy as a text-based simulator in a scientific subdomain is the degree of alignment between the LLM's pretraining data distribution and the epistemic, linguistic, and methodological norms of the target subdomain. The more representative and up-to-date the LLM's training data is of the subdomain's literature, discourse, and problem-solving methods, the higher the simulation accuracy. Conversely, misalignment in data, terminology, or reasoning conventions leads to systematic simulation errors.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM achieves high simulation accuracy in a subdomain with no representation in its training data, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If simulation accuracy remains unchanged after adding highly representative subdomain data to the LLM's training set, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently simulate subdomain reasoning accurately despite norm misalignment, the theory would be undermined.</li>
