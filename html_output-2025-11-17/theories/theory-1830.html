                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1830</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Abstraction and Probabilistic Synthesis Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when fine-tuned on hierarchically structured, domain-specific scientific corpora, develop internal representations that abstract scientific knowledge at multiple levels (e.g., methods, results, paradigms). These abstractions enable LLMs to synthesize probabilistic forecasts of future discoveries by integrating patterns across methodological, conceptual, and temporal hierarchies.</p>
