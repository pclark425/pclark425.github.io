                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement via LLM-Guided Literature Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can iteratively refine candidate quantitative laws by proposing, testing (via literature search and internal reasoning), and updating hypotheses in a closed loop. The LLM acts as both generator and critic, using its pretrained knowledge to propose laws, then searching for supporting or conflicting evidence in the literature, and refining the laws accordingly. This process converges on laws that are maximally consistent with the available evidence.</p>
