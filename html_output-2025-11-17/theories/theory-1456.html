                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is represented as a hierarchy of hybrid codes, integrating distributed, symbolic, and sensorimotor formats. These codes are organized in a predictive hierarchy, where higher levels generate predictions about lower-level representations, and lower levels provide error signals. The hybrid nature allows flexible, context-sensitive conceptual processing, supporting both abstract reasoning and grounded cognition.</p>

    <li>Behavioral and computational studies indicate that both grounded (sensorimotor) and abstract (symbolic) information are necessary for flexible conceptual use. </li>

                <li>Disruption at different hierarchical levels (e.g., via TMS) will produce distinct deficits in conceptual processing, depending on the level targeted.</li>
                <li>Computational models with hierarchical hybrid codes will outperform single-format models on tasks requiring both abstract and grounded reasoning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Real-time neural decoding will reveal dynamic shifts in the weighting of symbolic vs. sensorimotor components depending on task demands.</li>
                <li>Developmental studies will show that the integration of hybrid codes and predictive hierarchies emerges gradually with experience.</li>
                <li>Cross-linguistic studies will reveal that languages with more abstract conceptual vocabularies rely more on higher-level hybrid codes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual tasks can be performed without any evidence of hierarchical or hybrid code involvement, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If predictive coding signatures (e.g., top-down/bottom-up signaling) are absent during conceptual processing, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of affective and motivational systems in conceptual representation is not addressed. </li>
