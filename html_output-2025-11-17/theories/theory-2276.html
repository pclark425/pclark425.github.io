                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2276</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-LLM Co-Adaptation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the process of evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories is inherently co-adaptive: evaluators and LLMs mutually influence each other's outputs and standards over time. This co-adaptation can lead to emergent contamination, where both parties converge on shared heuristics, biases, or expectations, potentially reducing the diversity and originality of generated theories and their evaluations.</p>
