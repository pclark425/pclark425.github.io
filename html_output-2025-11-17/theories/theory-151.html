                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-View Fusion Optimality for Partial Observability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In partially observable environments with multiple viewpoints, optimal world models should: (1) encode each view separately to preserve view-specific information, (2) fuse views using probabilistic methods (Product of Experts) combined with contrastive alignment rather than naive concatenation or overlay, and (3) use contrastive learning to align view representations in a shared latent space. This approach outperforms single-view models and naive fusion methods (image overlay, simple concatenation), particularly in complex manipulation tasks where no single view provides complete information and where task-critical objects may be occluded in individual views. The performance gain increases with task complexity and degree of partial observability, but comes with increased computational cost (multiple encoders, contrastive losses) that must be justified by task requirements. For simpler tasks or when computational budget is limited, single-view or simpler fusion methods may be preferable.</p>
