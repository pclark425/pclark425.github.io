            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have been shown to generate molecules that are not only novel but also synthetically accessible, as measured by retrosynthesis tools. </li>
    <li>Retrosynthesis prediction models and LLMs trained on chemical data can propose synthetic routes for generated molecules, indicating an internalization of chemical feasibility. </li>
    <li>LLMs trained on large chemical corpora can generalize to propose molecules that obey chemical valency and stability rules. </li>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have generated molecules with novel scaffolds for specific property constraints in benchmark studies. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law generalizes the constraint-driven generation process as a function of latent knowledge, extending prior work on property-conditioned generation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Constraint-based molecule generation is a known application of generative models.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the role of LLMs' latent knowledge in enabling constraint-driven novelty.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover new classes of synthetically accessible molecules for applications where traditional methods have failed.</li>
                <li>LLMs could propose molecules that are synthetically accessible via novel, previously unreported reaction pathways.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify latent structure-activity relationships not previously recognized by human chemists.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs frequently generate molecules that are not synthetically accessible, the latent rule exploitation law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generate novel molecules for new constraints, the constraint-driven novelty law would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs generate molecules that consistently fail property or synthetic accessibility filters, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain how LLMs handle conflicting or mutually exclusive constraints. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address the impact of incomplete or biased training data on the diversity and feasibility of generated molecules. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
