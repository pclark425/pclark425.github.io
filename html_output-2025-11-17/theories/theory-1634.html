                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Alignment Principle for LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators in scientific subdomains is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the LLM's internal representations and the epistemic structure of the target subdomain. High alignment—where the LLM's learned abstractions, reasoning patterns, and knowledge organization closely mirror those of the scientific subdomain—enables accurate simulation, while misalignment leads to systematic errors, hallucinations, or shallow pattern-matching.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is fine-tuned on a corpus that is highly representative of a subdomain's epistemic structure, its simulation accuracy in that subdomain will increase.</li>
                <li>If a subdomain's epistemic structure is poorly represented in the LLM's training data, the LLM will make systematic errors when simulating that subdomain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new method is developed to explicitly encode subdomain epistemic structures into LLMs, it may enable accurate simulation in previously inaccessible scientific fields.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained on synthetic data designed to mimic the epistemic structure of a novel subdomain, their simulation accuracy may surpass that of models trained on real-world but misaligned data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy in a subdomain despite clear epistemic misalignment, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing alignment between LLM representations and subdomain structure does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs generalize well in subdomains with little explicit alignment, possibly due to emergent reasoning abilities. </li>
