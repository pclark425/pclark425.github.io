                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2311</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Homeostatic Failure Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from a progressive failure of the brain's homeostatic mechanisms—specifically, the regulation of synaptic plasticity, proteostasis, and metabolic balance—in response to age-related and environmental stressors. The breakdown of these regulatory systems leads to the accumulation of pathological proteins, synaptic dysfunction, and ultimately neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible by identifying subtle breakdowns in homeostatic regulation before overt pathology appears.</p>

                <li>Some individuals with robust homeostatic responses will remain cognitively normal despite high amyloid or tau burden.</li>
                <li>Restoring homeostatic regulation in late-stage AD will halt or reverse neurodegeneration.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with impaired homeostatic regulation do not develop AD at higher rates, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If static biomarkers consistently outperform dynamic homeostatic measures for early detection, the theory is weakened.</li>
