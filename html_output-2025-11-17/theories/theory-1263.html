                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structural Inductive Bias and Modality Adaptation Theory (General-Quantitative Extension)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This extension of the general theory introduces quantitative measures for the alignment between graph structure and language model inductive biases. It posits that the degree of alignment, as measured by structural similarity metrics and information-theoretic quantities, predicts the efficiency and effectiveness of language model training on graph-to-text tasks. The theory further asserts that optimal representations maximize mutual information between graph substructures and their textual realizations, subject to the constraints of the model's inductive biases.</p>
