                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The brain uses unsupervised learning mechanisms to discover the latent structure of tasks before or during supervised learning of task-specific mappings. This unsupervised structure discovery operates through Hebbian plasticity mechanisms that extract principal components and group commonly co-occurring features, effectively performing dimensionality reduction and feature discovery. When tasks share latent structure (common underlying features or dimensions), unsupervised learning discovers these shared components and creates representations that facilitate positive transfer and compositional generalization. When tasks have independent structure, unsupervised learning orthogonalizes their representations, reducing interference. This process is particularly effective during blocked training because sustained exposure to one task context allows unsupervised mechanisms to converge on that task's structure before switching to another task. Unsupervised pretraining on task structure (even without labels) can substantially improve subsequent supervised learning efficiency and transfer. This mechanism explains why humans can rapidly learn new tasks that recombine familiar features and why blocked training facilitates both learning and transfer.</p>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Providing unsupervised exposure to task stimuli before supervised training should improve learning speed and transfer, with benefits proportional to exposure duration</li>
                <li>Tasks with clearer statistical structure (more distinct clusters, lower-dimensional manifolds) should benefit more from unsupervised structure discovery than tasks with noisy or high-dimensional structure</li>
                <li>Individual differences in unsupervised learning ability should predict differences in multi-task learning and transfer performance</li>
                <li>Brain regions involved in unsupervised structure discovery (e.g., hippocampus for statistical learning, sensory cortices for feature extraction) should show activity during task exposure even without feedback</li>
                <li>Blocking unsupervised learning mechanisms (e.g., through disruption of Hebbian plasticity) should impair both learning efficiency and transfer</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal balance between unsupervised structure discovery and supervised learning might depend on task statistics in complex ways; too much unsupervised learning might discover spurious structure while too little might miss important regularities</li>
                <li>Unsupervised structure discovery might be more important early in learning or development, with supervised mechanisms dominating later; the developmental trajectory is unknown</li>
                <li>Different brain regions might specialize in discovering different types of structure (e.g., sensory features vs. abstract rules); the division of labor is not fully understood</li>
                <li>Active exploration or curiosity-driven behavior might enhance structure discovery compared to passive exposure, but the mechanisms and magnitude of this effect are unknown</li>
                <li>Structure discovery might be hierarchical, with lower-level features discovered first and higher-level structure built on top; the dynamics of hierarchical discovery are not well characterized</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If unsupervised pretraining does not improve subsequent supervised learning or transfer, this would challenge the functional importance of structure discovery</li>
                <li>If blocking Hebbian plasticity does not impair structure discovery or its benefits, this would challenge the mechanistic role of Hebbian learning</li>
                <li>If blocked and interleaved training produce identical structure discovery despite different behavioral outcomes, this would question the link between training schedule and structure discovery</li>
                <li>If tasks with clear statistical structure do not benefit more from unsupervised learning than tasks with noisy structure, this would challenge the role of structure quality</li>
                <li>If brain regions hypothesized to perform structure discovery do not show learning-related changes during unsupervised exposure, this would question their role</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
