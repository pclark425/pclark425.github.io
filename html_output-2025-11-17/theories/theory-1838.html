                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Signal Extraction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by extracting and aggregating latent predictive signals embedded in the language, citation patterns, and argumentation structures of scientific texts. These signals, which may be implicit (e.g., hedging, citation bursts, shifts in terminology), are processed by the LLM to form probabilistic judgments about the likelihood of future discoveries.</p>
