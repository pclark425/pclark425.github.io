                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically leveraging a hierarchy of memory systems—short-term, episodic, and semantic—based on task demands, context, and resource constraints. The agent allocates memory access and storage according to the temporal relevance, abstraction level, and expected future utility of information, enabling both efficient retrieval and continual adaptation.</p>
