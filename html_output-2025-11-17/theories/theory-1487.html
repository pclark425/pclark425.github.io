                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is not strictly modal (tied to sensory-motor systems) or amodal (abstracted from sensory-motor details), but exists along a continuum. The brain dynamically hybridizes modal and amodal representations depending on context, task demands, and learning history. This hybridization allows for flexible, context-sensitive conceptual processing, supporting both grounded and abstract cognition.</p>

                <li>Patients with partial lesions will show graded, not all-or-none, deficits in conceptual tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially biasing the brain toward one end of the continuum (e.g., via TMS) will alter the hybridization and affect conceptual flexibility.</li>
                <li>Developmental trajectories will show a shift from more modal to more hybrid/amodal representations with age and education.</li>
                <li>Machine learning models with explicit hybridization modules will better match human conceptual flexibility than purely modal or amodal models.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual representations are always strictly modal or amodal, with no evidence of hybridization, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate the representational format, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
