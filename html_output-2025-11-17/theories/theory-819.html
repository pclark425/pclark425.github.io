                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance and generalization by constructing and maintaining hierarchical memory structures. By abstracting low-level experiences into higher-level schemas and concepts, agents can efficiently transfer knowledge, reason across tasks, and avoid redundant learning, leading to scalable self-improvement.</p>
