                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For learning world models in text games, predicting the difference between consecutive knowledge graph states (G_{t+1} - G_t) rather than predicting the full next state (G_{t+1}) provides substantial computational and learning efficiency benefits because: (1) differences are sparse (typically 3-4 triples vs 8-9 triples for full graphs), (2) difference prediction naturally handles the set-valued nature of graphs, (3) it reduces label imbalance in multi-task learning, and (4) it enables better generalization by focusing on state transitions rather than absolute states.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Predicting graph differences (G_{t+1} - G_t) reduces target sequence length by 50-70% compared to predicting full graphs, leading to 30-50% improvement in graph-level exact match accuracy.</li>
                <li>The sparsity of graph differences enables better handling of the set-valued nature of knowledge graphs, as the model can focus on changes rather than maintaining full state consistency.</li>
                <li>Graph-difference prediction provides stronger learning signal for world model dynamics because it explicitly represents state transitions rather than requiring the model to implicitly compute differences.</li>
                <li>In multi-task learning scenarios, graph-difference prediction reduces interference between tasks by providing a more balanced target distribution.</li>
                <li>The benefit of difference prediction scales with graph size: for graphs with <5 triples, benefit is <15%; for graphs with 5-15 triples, benefit is 30-50%; for graphs with >15 triples, benefit exceeds 60%.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Worldformer predicting graph differences achieves 39.15% graph-level EM, substantially outperforming baselines <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.0" class="evidence-link">[e235.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Average graph-diff triples per state is 3.42 compared to 8.71 for full graphs, representing 60% reduction in target size <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.0" class="evidence-link">[e235.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-237.html#e237.2" class="evidence-link">[e237.2]</a> </li>
    <li>GATA-W predicting add/del operations (larger target than pure differences) underperforms Worldformer <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.1" class="evidence-link">[e235.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Seq2Seq predicting full graphs struggles with large vocabularies and achieves only 14.29% graph-level EM <a href="../results/extraction-result-237.html#e237.2" class="evidence-link">[e237.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Graph-difference formulation produces the largest ablation loss when removed from Worldformer <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.0" class="evidence-link">[e235.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Worldformer's multi-task learning benefits from graph-difference prediction reducing label imbalance in action prediction <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.0" class="evidence-link">[e235.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a text game domain with larger knowledge graphs (average 20+ triples per state), difference prediction will show >70% improvement in graph-level EM compared to full-graph prediction.</li>
                <li>For rapidly changing environments where >50% of graph triples change each step, difference prediction will show reduced advantage (<20% improvement) compared to slower-changing environments.</li>
                <li>Applying difference prediction to other structured prediction tasks (e.g., scene graphs in vision) will yield similar 30-50% improvements in exact match accuracy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For environments with very sparse changes (<2 triples per step), it's unclear whether difference prediction still provides benefits or whether the overhead of computing differences negates advantages - effect could range from -5% to +15%.</li>
                <li>In highly stochastic environments where the same action produces different graph changes, difference prediction might struggle more than full-state prediction - performance difference unknown, possibly -10% to +20%.</li>
                <li>For tasks requiring reasoning about cumulative effects over many steps, difference prediction might lose global consistency - impact on downstream task performance unclear.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding domains where full-graph prediction consistently outperforms difference prediction would challenge the efficiency claim.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that difference prediction provides no benefit for small graphs (<5 triples) would challenge the scalability claim.</li>
                <li>Showing that difference prediction leads to error accumulation over long trajectories (>100 steps) that exceeds the benefits would challenge the approach.</li>
                <li>Finding that difference prediction provides no advantage in multi-task learning scenarios would challenge the label-balance mechanism.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to handle cases where computing the difference is ambiguous (e.g., entity renaming vs. deletion+addition) is not fully addressed <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.0" class="evidence-link">[e235.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The optimal encoding scheme for representing differences (explicit add/delete vs. implicit) is not systematically compared <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.0" class="evidence-link">[e235.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.1" class="evidence-link">[e235.1]</a> </li>
    <li>How difference prediction interacts with different graph update frequencies (every step vs. every N steps) is not explored <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.0" class="evidence-link">[e235.0]</a> </li>
