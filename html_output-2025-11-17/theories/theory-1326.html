                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Decorrelation and Externalization Theory of LLM Self-Reflection (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) improve their answer quality through a process of iterative decorrelation and externalization. In each iteration, the model generates an answer, then externalizes its reasoning and critiques, which are used to decorrelate subsequent responses from prior biases and errors. This process enables the model to escape local minima in reasoning, leading to higher-quality, more robust answers over multiple generate-then-reflect cycles.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LLMs using self-reflection or critique can correct prior mistakes and reduce repetition of the same error. </li>
    <li>Reflection prompts that require explicit reasoning or error identification lead to more diverse and accurate subsequent outputs. </li>
    <li>Iterative self-refinement (e.g., Self-Refine, STaR) demonstrates that explicit critique steps reduce error persistence across iterations. </li>
    <li>Chain-of-thought and error analysis prompts lead to less correlated error patterns in subsequent LLM outputs. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While iterative prompting and self-reflection are known, the explicit law of decorrelation via externalization is a novel abstraction.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that self-reflection and critique can improve LLM performance, and that iterative prompting can reduce certain errors.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of decorrelation as a mechanism—where externalized reflection actively reduces correlation with prior errors—is new.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The role of externalization as a necessary and sufficient condition for iterative improvement is a novel theoretical statement.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that explicit reasoning and critique can improve LLM outputs.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the necessity of externalization (not just internal reflection) for quality improvement.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is forced to externalize its critique after each answer, subsequent answers will show reduced repetition of the same error compared to simple retries.</li>
                <li>If the reflection step is omitted or not externalized, iterative improvement in answer quality will be significantly reduced.</li>
                <li>If the externalized reflection is made more explicit and detailed, the degree of decorrelation and improvement will increase.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the externalized reflection is itself decorrelated from the original answer (e.g., by using a different model or randomization), the improvement may be even greater.</li>
                <li>If the reflection is adversarially manipulated to reinforce prior errors, iterative improvement may stall or reverse.</li>
                <li>If the LLM is trained to ignore its own externalized reflection, will iterative improvement still occur?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs improve answer quality over iterations without any externalized reflection, this would challenge the necessity of externalization.</li>
                <li>If decorrelation does not occur (i.e., the same errors persist despite reflection), the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If externalized reflection leads to overfitting to prior errors rather than decorrelation, the theory would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs improve with simple retries, even without explicit reflection or externalization. </li>
    <li>Instances where externalized reflection is present but does not lead to improvement, possibly due to model limitations or task ambiguity. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
