                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Skill Acquisition and Task Decomposition Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) improve their answer quality through iterative generate-then-reflect cycles by acquiring meta-skills—generalizable strategies for error detection, correction, and reasoning—via explicit and implicit task decomposition. Through self-reflection, LLMs recursively break down complex tasks and their own outputs into subcomponents, enabling targeted self-improvement and the emergence of higher-order cognitive abilities.</p>
