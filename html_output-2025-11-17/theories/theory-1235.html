                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1235</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Text-Guided Latent Editing for Application-Driven Molecular Design</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can perform iterative editing in a shared latent space, guided by natural language feedback, to converge on molecular structures that fulfill specific application requirements. The process leverages the LLM's ability to interpret and act upon sequential text prompts, enabling a closed-loop optimization cycle for molecular design.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>If iterative text feedback does not result in measurable improvement in generated molecule properties, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot encode or act upon application-specific constraints described in natural language, the theory would be undermined.</li>
