                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bilevel LLM-Simulation Theory of Quantitative Law Distillation (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can be used in a bilevel simulation framework to distill quantitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers. At the first level, LLMs simulate the extraction and synthesis of candidate variables, relationships, and data representations from text. At the second level, LLMs simulate the process of scientific reasoning, including hypothesis generation, model selection, and quantitative law formulation, using the outputs of the first level as input. The interaction between these two levels enables the emergence of novel, robust, and generalizable quantitative laws that are not explicitly stated in any single paper but are abstracted from the collective evidence.</p>
