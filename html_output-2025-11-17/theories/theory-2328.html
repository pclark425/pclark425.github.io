                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2328</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration Cascade Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease is initiated by a cascade of failures in large-scale brain network connectivity, triggered by local molecular insults (e.g., amyloid, tau, inflammation). The breakdown of network hubs leads to global cognitive dysfunction, and the spatial-temporal pattern of network disintegration predicts symptom onset and progression. Early detection is possible by mapping network connectivity changes using advanced neuroimaging and computational modeling.</p>

                <li>Demonstrating that molecular pathology without network disintegration leads to AD would falsify the cascade model.</li>
