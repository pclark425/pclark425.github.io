                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Management Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by actively managing their memory contents through selective encoding, consolidation, and forgetting. The agent continuously evaluates the utility of stored information, prioritizing retention of task-relevant memories and discarding or compressing less useful data. This active management enables efficient use of limited memory resources and supports adaptation to changing task demands.</p>
