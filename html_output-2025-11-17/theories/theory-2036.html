                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large corpora of scholarly literature, can perform inductive synthesis of quantitative laws by extracting, abstracting, and generalizing mathematical relationships described in text, tables, and figures, thereby accelerating the discovery of robust, generalizable scientific laws.</p>
