                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain-Alignment Generalization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators in scientific subdomains is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the LLM's pretraining data distribution and the linguistic, conceptual, and procedural characteristics of the target subdomain. When the subdomain's language, reasoning patterns, and procedural logic are well-represented in the LLM's training data, simulation accuracy is high; when they are underrepresented or structurally divergent, accuracy degrades, regardless of model scale.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will perform better on simulation tasks in subdomains with abundant, high-quality open-access literature (e.g., genomics) than in proprietary or emerging fields (e.g., quantum computing).</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If a subdomain's procedural logic is well-represented but its terminology is novel, LLMs may achieve partial simulation accuracy.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy in subdomains with little or no representation in pretraining data, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If simulation accuracy does not improve with increased data alignment, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs may generalize to structurally novel subdomains via emergent reasoning, even with little data alignment. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
