                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This specific theory asserts that the representational format of conceptual knowledge is dynamically modulated by context, such that the brain flexibly shifts the balance between distributed, symbolic, and sensorimotor codes depending on task demands, prior knowledge, and environmental cues. This modulation is implemented via top-down signals from prefrontal and parietal control systems, which bias the activation and integration of different representational formats within the hierarchy.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows that task context modulates the engagement of different neural networks during conceptual processing. </li>
    <li>Prefrontal and parietal regions are implicated in cognitive control and context-dependent modulation of semantic processing. </li>
    <li>Multivariate pattern analyses reveal that the neural code for concepts shifts depending on whether tasks require abstract or sensorimotor reasoning. </li>
    <li>Patients with prefrontal damage show impaired flexibility in conceptual tasks that require context-dependent format shifts. </li>
    <li>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to prefrontal or parietal cortex disrupts context-appropriate engagement of conceptual representations. </li>
    <li>Behavioral studies show that context cues bias the use of imagery, verbal, or action-based strategies in conceptual reasoning. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While contextual modulation and cognitive control are well-established, the specific mechanism of format selection within a hybrid representational hierarchy is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Context-dependent modulation of semantic processing and the role of prefrontal/parietal control in cognitive flexibility are established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit claim that context modulates the balance between distributed, symbolic, and sensorimotor codes within a hierarchical hybrid system, and that this is implemented by top-down control signals.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Shifting task context (e.g., from abstract to concrete) will induce measurable changes in the relative activation of distributed, symbolic, and sensorimotor networks.</li>
                <li>Disruption of prefrontal or parietal control regions will impair the ability to flexibly shift representational format in response to context.</li>
                <li>Behavioral performance on conceptual tasks will correlate with the degree of context-appropriate format engagement.</li>
                <li>Neuroimaging will reveal increased functional connectivity between control regions and representational subsystems during context shifts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Real-time neurofeedback training to enhance context-appropriate format engagement will improve conceptual flexibility.</li>
                <li>In neuropsychiatric conditions with impaired cognitive control (e.g., schizophrenia), context-dependent format modulation will be disrupted.</li>
                <li>Artificial systems with explicit context-modulated hybrid architectures will show improved generalization and flexibility.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological modulation of prefrontal cortex will alter the flexibility of representational format selection.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If context does not modulate the balance between representational formats, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If disruption of control regions does not impair format selection, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If individuals with prefrontal lesions show normal context-dependent representational shifts, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of subcortical structures (e.g., thalamus, basal ganglia) in format modulation is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The influence of long-term learning and developmental changes on context-dependent format modulation is not specified. </li>
