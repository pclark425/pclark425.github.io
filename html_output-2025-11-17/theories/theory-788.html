                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically selecting, updating, and retrieving memories based on a relevance signal computed from both the current context and anticipated future subgoals. The agent's memory system is adaptive, modifying its structure and retrieval policy in response to evolving task demands, which enables efficient use of limited memory resources and improved generalization to novel tasks.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that retrieval-augmented models outperform static memory models when memory access is guided by context relevance (e.g., Khandelwal et al., 2020; Lample et al., 2019). </li>
    <li>Human cognition research demonstrates that memory retrieval is context- and goal-dependent (Tulving & Thomson, 1973). </li>
    <li>Recent work in large language models (LLMs) shows that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy and reasoning by selecting relevant information from external memory (Lewis et al., 2020). </li>
    <li>Studies in multi-step reasoning tasks show that agents benefit from retrieving information not just relevant to the current input, but also to anticipated future steps (Shen et al., 2023). </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While context-based retrieval is well-studied, the theory's emphasis on future subgoals and dynamic policy adaptation is a new synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Retrieval-augmented language models and context-based memory access are established in both machine learning and cognitive science.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit integration of anticipated subgoals into the relevance computation and the dynamic adaptation of retrieval policy to evolving task demands is novel.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Existing work adapts memory over episodes or tasks, but not typically in a fine-grained, online, context-sensitive manner as described here.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Meta-learning and continual learning approaches adapt model parameters or memory to new tasks.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit, online modification of both memory structure and retrieval policy in response to detected context/task changes within a single agent is novel.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If agents with dynamic, relevance-guided memory do not outperform static-memory agents on tasks with shifting goals or contexts, the theory would be called into question.</li>
