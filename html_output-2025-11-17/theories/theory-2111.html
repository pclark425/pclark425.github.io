                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Synthesis Theory (IRAST) – General Framework</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> IRAST posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by iteratively retrieving relevant evidence, synthesizing candidate theory statements, and refining these statements through cycles of retrieval, evaluation, and synthesis. The process leverages the LLM's ability to semantically index, abstract, and reason over heterogeneous evidence, enabling the emergence of high-level, testable scientific theories that are both grounded in the literature and generalizable to new queries.</p>
