                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Language Model Structural Pattern Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models can be used to detect anomalies in lists by learning and modeling the structural and syntactic patterns that characterize normal lists. Anomalies are detected as deviations from these learned patterns, which can include formatting, ordering, or categorical structure.</p>
