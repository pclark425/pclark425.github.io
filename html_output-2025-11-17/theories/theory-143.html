                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Degree-Similarity Trade-off in Information Network Navigation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about navigation complexity in text worlds that relates graph-topology features (diameter, clustering, dead-ends, door constraints) to exploration efficiency and optimal policy structure, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In information networks like Wikipedia, optimal navigation policies must dynamically balance between following high-degree hub nodes (which provide many options and shortcuts through the network core) and following high-similarity nodes (which are semantically closer to the target). The optimal balance shifts systematically as a function of path position: early in the path, degree should be weighted heavily to 'escape' the local neighborhood and reach well-connected regions of the network; late in the path, similarity should dominate to 'home in' on the specific target. This creates a position-dependent weighting function where degree weight decreases and similarity weight increases along the path. The theory applies specifically to small-world information networks with heterogeneous degree distributions where targets are typically low-degree, topic-specific nodes. The optimal weighting can be learned from example paths and represents a fundamental trade-off between exploration (via hubs) and exploitation (via similarity).</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Optimal degree weight w_d(t) decreases monotonically with path position t, while similarity weight w_s(t) increases monotonically, where t is normalized by expected path length.</li>
                <li>The crossover point where w_s(t) > w_d(t) typically occurs at approximately 40-60% of the expected path length in Wikipedia-like networks.</li>
                <li>In small-world networks with power-law degree distributions (like Wikipedia), the degree-similarity trade-off is more pronounced than in homogeneous networks because hubs provide shortcuts but targets are low-degree.</li>
                <li>Target nodes in information networks are typically low-degree, topic-specific pages, making pure degree-based navigation fail in the final steps (overhead factors 20-51 for degree-only).</li>
                <li>The optimal weighting function can be learned from example paths and generalizes across similar information networks with comparable topology.</li>
                <li>Early in the path (t < 0.3), degree weight should be approximately 2-3x similarity weight to efficiently reach the network core.</li>
                <li>Late in the path (t > 0.7), similarity weight should be approximately 3-5x degree weight to efficiently reach specific targets.</li>
                <li>The trade-off is most critical in networks where the ratio of hub-degree to target-degree is high (>10x).</li>
                <li>Position-dependent policies outperform fixed-weight policies by 15-30% in path efficiency on Wikipedia-like networks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In Wikipedia navigation, learned agents that adapt degree/similarity weights by path position achieve lower overhead than fixed-weight heuristics, with position-dependent learned weights outperforming fixed heuristics. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1376.html#e1376.0" class="evidence-link">[e1376.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Degree-only navigation (DBN) performs very poorly on Wikipedia with overhead factors of 20-51 and 81-86% of paths being long (>2x optimal), demonstrating that pure degree-based navigation is insufficient. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1376.html#e1376.6" class="evidence-link">[e1376.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Human navigators on Wikipedia show position-dependent behavior, using high-degree nodes early in paths and similarity-based selection later, with degree weight decreasing and similarity weight increasing along the path. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1371.html#e1371.3" class="evidence-link">[e1371.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1376.html#e1376.0" class="evidence-link">[e1376.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Shortest-path algorithms on Wikipedia tend to choose high-betweenness nodes (correlated with degree) but differ from humans in not emphasizing textual similarity, leading to different node choices especially mid-path. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1371.html#e1371.3" class="evidence-link">[e1371.3]</a> </li>
    <li>In WikiNav tasks, recurrent policies (NeuAgent-Rec) that can adapt over path history outperform feedforward policies, especially for longer paths (higher Nh), demonstrating the importance of history-dependent weighting. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1267.html#e1267.1" class="evidence-link">[e1267.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1267.html#e1267.3" class="evidence-link">[e1267.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Curiosity-biased PageRank that combines standard PageRank (degree-based) with learned Q-values improves human-transition prediction by 32.2% on Wikispeedia when combining IGT and CPT biases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1236.html#e1236.2" class="evidence-link">[e1236.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Expected-Value Navigation (EVN) that uses fixed probabilistic incorporation of degree underperforms on Wikipedia because link endpoints are not independently sampled and topology undermines EVN assumptions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1376.html#e1376.5" class="evidence-link">[e1376.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Similarity-Based Navigation (SBN) that emphasizes content similarity performs better than degree-only approaches, supporting the importance of similarity especially later in paths. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1376.html#e1376.4" class="evidence-link">[e1376.4]</a> </li>
    <li>In word association networks (HBC), humans preferentially follow short semantic steps and hierarchical patterns, indicating similarity-based navigation in semantic spaces. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1363.html#e1363.0" class="evidence-link">[e1363.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1363.html#e1363.1" class="evidence-link">[e1363.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Random Surfing (RS) policies that combine local exploration with jumps outperform pure random or pure preferential acquisition in information networks, suggesting a balance between local (similarity) and global (degree) navigation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1194.html#e1194.0" class="evidence-link">[e1194.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1194.html#e1194.2" class="evidence-link">[e1194.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Wikipedia's small-world connectivity (diameter ~9, mean shortest path ~3) and hub structure enable short paths when degree is used early, but targets are often reached via low-degree topic-specific nodes requiring similarity later. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1376.html#e1376.0" class="evidence-link">[e1376.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1371.html#e1371.3" class="evidence-link">[e1371.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a new information network with similar small-world properties to Wikipedia (diameter 5-10, power-law degree), a position-dependent weighting policy will outperform fixed-weight policies by >15% in path efficiency.</li>
                <li>Artificially increasing the degree of target nodes in Wikipedia (by adding random incoming links) will reduce the performance gap between degree-based and similarity-based navigation by 30-50%.</li>
                <li>In the first 30% of navigation paths, removing high-degree nodes (top 5% by degree) will increase path length by >50%, while removing high-similarity nodes will increase it by <20%.</li>
                <li>In the last 30% of navigation paths, removing high-similarity nodes will increase path length by >40%, while removing high-degree nodes will increase it by <15%.</li>
                <li>Training a neural network to predict optimal degree/similarity weights as a function of path position will converge to a monotonically decreasing/increasing pattern respectively.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal crossover point may vary significantly across different types of information networks (e.g., citation networks vs social networks vs knowledge graphs), potentially ranging from 30-70% of path length.</li>
                <li>In networks with very different degree distributions (e.g., more homogeneous Erdős-Rényi graphs), the degree-similarity trade-off may disappear entirely or reverse, with similarity dominating throughout.</li>
                <li>The trade-off may interact with clustering coefficient in complex ways: high clustering might shift the crossover point earlier (favor similarity sooner) or later (hubs remain useful longer).</li>
                <li>In multilingual or cross-domain information networks, the similarity metric itself may need to be position-dependent (lexical early, semantic late).</li>
                <li>The theory may extend to temporal networks where degree and similarity both change over time, requiring a 2D weighting function w(t, time).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding information networks where pure degree-based navigation consistently outperforms position-dependent policies would challenge the theory's core claim.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the optimal weighting function is not monotonic (e.g., oscillates or has multiple peaks) would contradict the theory's fundamental structure.</li>
                <li>Showing that the crossover point varies randomly rather than systematically with network properties would invalidate the predictability claim.</li>
                <li>Finding that learned position-dependent policies do not generalize across similar networks would challenge the theory's generalizability claim.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that in Wikipedia-like networks, targets are actually high-degree nodes would undermine the motivation for the similarity phase.</li>
                <li>Showing that fixed-weight policies can match position-dependent policies through other mechanisms (e.g., better similarity metrics) would suggest the position-dependence is not fundamental.</li>
            </ol>
