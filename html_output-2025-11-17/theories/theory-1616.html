                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1616</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Contextualization Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is governed by their ability to dynamically contextualize queries within the latent structure of the subdomain, integrating both explicit prompt information and implicit background knowledge. Simulation accuracy is maximized when the LLM can (1) infer the relevant context from minimal cues, (2) retrieve and synthesize latent domain knowledge, and (3) adapt its reasoning trajectory in response to intermediate outputs, akin to expert human reasoning.</p>
