                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Task Decomposition and Reflective Supervision Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) perform self-reflection and iterative answer improvement by decomposing complex tasks into subtasks, generating initial outputs, and then supervising their own process through meta-level evaluation and targeted revision. The process is hierarchical: at each iteration, the model identifies subcomponents of the problem or answer that require further attention, applies targeted reflection, and integrates improvements, leading to higher answer quality over multiple generate-then-reflect cycles.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is trained to perform meta-level supervision on its own decomposition process (i.e., reflect on its own task breakdowns), it may develop emergent abilities for self-correction beyond current capabilities.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical reflection may enable LLMs to identify and correct subtle, high-level conceptual errors that are missed by flat, non-hierarchical reflection.</li>
                <li>LLMs with explicit meta-level supervision may develop forms of self-monitoring that generalize to novel, unseen task types.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show improved answer quality when reflecting on decomposed subtasks versus whole-task reflection, the theory's hierarchical aspect is called into question.</li>
                <li>If meta-level supervision does not lead to targeted, effective revisions, the theory's claim about the role of supervision is weakened.</li>
                <li>If repeated generate-then-reflect cycles do not improve or even degrade answer quality, the theory's iterative improvement claim is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs improve answers without explicit decomposition or meta-level reflection, possibly due to implicit learning or memorization. </li>
