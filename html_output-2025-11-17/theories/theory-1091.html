                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Abstraction and Modular Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve strict logical reasoning by developing internal modular representations that abstract and compose logical rules, allowing for systematic generalization and error correction. The theory claims that the best logical reasoning performance arises when LMs are architected or trained to discover, represent, and manipulate compositional logical modules, rather than relying solely on end-to-end pattern learning.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Unsupervised discovery of logical modules may enable LMs to invent new forms of logic or reasoning strategies.</li>
                <li>Combining modular abstraction with external memory may yield synergistic improvements in logical reasoning.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If modular LMs do not outperform monolithic LMs on strict logical reasoning tasks, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If module-level error correction does not reduce logical inconsistencies, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If LMs can generalize to novel logical forms without modular abstraction, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LMs show limited compositional generalization even without explicit modularity, possibly due to implicit structure in attention patterns. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
