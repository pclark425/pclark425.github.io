                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically modulating the encoding, retrieval, and consolidation of memory based on task demands, environmental feedback, and internal uncertainty. The agent's memory system is not static, but adaptively allocates resources and retrieval strategies to maximize utility for the current and anticipated tasks.</p>
