                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Shortest-Path Planning with Learned Heuristics Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents perform planning with external tools in partially observable text environments, including belief-state updates that incorporate tool outputs and guide shortest-path actions.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that agents in partially observable text environments can achieve near-optimal shortest-path planning by learning heuristic functions that estimate the minimum number of actions (including tool invocations) required to reach goal states from current belief states. The learned heuristic h_θ(b) maps belief states b to estimated costs-to-goal, where the belief state is continuously updated based on observations from the environment and outputs from external tools. The heuristic is trained on solved planning problems to predict the true shortest path length, and during planning, guides search algorithms (such as A* or greedy best-first search) to prioritize exploring belief states with lower estimated costs. The key innovation is that the heuristic learns to jointly reason about: (1) the information value of tool invocations for reducing uncertainty, (2) the cost of tool usage versus direct actions, and (3) the expected path length after belief updates from tool outputs. This enables the agent to make informed decisions about when to gather information via tools versus when to act directly, optimizing for the shortest path to the goal.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The learned heuristic h_θ(b) estimates the minimum number of actions required to reach a goal state from belief state b, where actions include both environment actions and tool invocations.</li>
                <li>The heuristic is trained using supervised learning on a dataset of solved planning problems, where the target is the true shortest path length from each encountered belief state to the goal.</li>
                <li>During planning, the heuristic guides search algorithms by prioritizing expansion of belief states with lower h_θ(b) values, approximating shortest-path search.</li>
                <li>Belief states are updated after each action using Bayes' rule: b'(s') ∝ P(o|s',a) Σ_s P(s'|s,a) b(s), where o is the observation (including tool outputs), a is the action, and s represents world states.</li>
                <li>The learned heuristic implicitly captures the value of information from tool outputs by learning that belief states with high uncertainty but access to informative tools have lower estimated costs than similar belief states without such access.</li>
                <li>For text environments, the belief state representation encodes the agent's uncertainty about entity states, locations, properties, and relationships based on partial textual observations and tool outputs.</li>
                <li>The heuristic learns to balance exploration (using tools to reduce uncertainty) versus exploitation (taking direct actions toward the goal) by estimating which strategy leads to shorter overall paths.</li>
                <li>When the heuristic is approximately admissible (never significantly overestimates true cost), A* search with this heuristic produces near-optimal shortest paths with bounded suboptimality.</li>
                <li>The quality of shortest-path planning improves as the heuristic becomes more accurate, with the relationship: expected_path_length ≤ optimal_path_length × (1 + ε), where ε depends on heuristic error.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Learned heuristics have been successfully applied to classical planning problems, demonstrating that neural networks can learn to estimate goal distance from state representations. </li>
    <li>A* search with admissible heuristics guarantees optimal (shortest) paths, and learned heuristics can approximate admissible heuristics while being more informative than hand-crafted ones. </li>
    <li>In partially observable environments, belief-state planning requires maintaining probability distributions over possible world states, which can be updated using Bayesian inference when new observations are received. </li>
    <li>Tool use in AI agents involves deciding when to invoke external functions to gather information or perform actions, which requires reasoning about the information gain versus cost trade-off. </li>
    <li>Heuristic search in belief space can be made more efficient by learning heuristics that account for the expected information gain from observations. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents using learned heuristics will find shorter paths to goals compared to agents using uninformed search (e.g., breadth-first search) or hand-crafted heuristics in novel text environments.</li>
                <li>The learned heuristic will assign lower cost estimates to belief states where informative tools are available and uncertainty is high, predicting that tool use will lead to shorter overall paths.</li>
                <li>Training the heuristic on diverse planning problems will enable it to generalize to new text environments with similar structure, producing near-optimal paths without retraining.</li>
                <li>The number of belief states expanded during search will be significantly reduced when using the learned heuristic compared to uninformed search, demonstrating computational efficiency.</li>
                <li>In environments where tool outputs provide high information gain, the learned heuristic will guide agents to use tools early in the plan, even if this increases immediate action count, because it reduces total path length.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether the learned heuristic can effectively handle dynamic environments where the optimal path changes during execution due to unexpected tool outputs or environment changes is uncertain but critical for real-world deployment.</li>
                <li>It is unknown whether the heuristic can learn to reason about tool composition (using multiple tools in sequence) to achieve information gains that no single tool provides, which would enable more sophisticated shortest-path strategies.</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial or noisy tool outputs can cause the learned heuristic to guide the agent toward significantly suboptimal paths is unclear but has important robustness implications.</li>
                <li>The extent to which the learned heuristic can transfer across different types of text environments (e.g., from household navigation to web navigation) while maintaining shortest-path guarantees is unknown but would be highly impactful.</li>
                <li>Whether the heuristic can learn to detect when it is in a region of the belief space where its estimates are unreliable and fall back to safer planning strategies is uncertain but important for safety-critical applications.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the learned heuristic consistently guides agents to paths that are significantly longer than the optimal path (e.g., >50% longer), this would indicate the heuristic is not effectively learning cost-to-goal estimates.</li>
                <li>If agents using the learned heuristic perform worse than agents using simple hand-crafted heuristics (e.g., goal distance ignoring partial observability), this would question the value of learning.</li>
                <li>If the heuristic assigns similar cost estimates to belief states with very different true costs-to-goal (e.g., near-goal states vs. far-from-goal states), this would indicate the heuristic lacks discriminative power.</li>
                <li>If increasing the training dataset size or model capacity does not improve the shortest-path performance, this would suggest fundamental limitations in the learning approach.</li>
                <li>If the heuristic fails to generalize to slightly modified versions of training environments (e.g., with additional objects or rooms), this would indicate overfitting and poor generalization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle continuous or very large belief spaces where exact belief-state representation and update may be intractable. </li>
    <li>The computational cost of belief-state updates after tool outputs, especially for complex tools that provide rich information, is not fully characterized. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle tool failures or unreliable tool outputs that may corrupt the belief state. </li>
    <li>The optimal architecture for the neural network implementing h_θ is not specified, and different architectures may have different inductive biases affecting shortest-path performance. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
