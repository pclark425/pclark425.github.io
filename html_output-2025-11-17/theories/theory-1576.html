                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1576</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal Shortcut Networks via Wormhole Engineering</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL travel can be achieved by creating and stabilizing traversable wormholes—shortcuts through spacetime—using advanced quantum field and gravitational engineering. By constructing a network of microscopic or mesoscopic wormholes and expanding them to usable size, spacecraft could traverse vast distances instantaneously. The theory explores how near-future advances in quantum gravity, negative energy generation, and nanotechnology could make wormhole stabilization feasible within realistic budgets.</p>
