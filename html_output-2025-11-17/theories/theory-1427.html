                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1427</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Error Signal Amplification through Iterative Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that iterative self-reflection in LLMs acts as an error signal amplifier, where each round of self-critique increases the salience of errors or inconsistencies in the output. By repeatedly surfacing and addressing these issues, the model is able to converge on more accurate and robust answers, even in the absence of external feedback. The process is hypothesized to be analogous to error backpropagation in neural networks, but operating at the level of output text and reasoning chains.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In some cases, error amplification may lead to overcorrection or the introduction of new errors, especially in ambiguous tasks.</li>
                <li>Iterative self-reflection may enable LLMs to self-discover subtle or emergent errors not detectable in single-pass generation.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If error detection does not improve with additional self-reflection cycles, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If outputs do not converge to a stable state after multiple iterations, the error attenuation law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some errors may persist undetected due to model blind spots or limitations in self-critique capabilities. </li>
