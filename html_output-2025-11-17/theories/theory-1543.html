                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1543</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metric Engineering for FTL Travel via Local Spacetime Manipulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by engineering local spacetime metrics using achievable energy densities and advanced field configurations, it is possible to create effective FTL travel corridors. These corridors do not violate local causality or require negative energy densities, but instead exploit non-trivial spacetime geometries (e.g., engineered geodesics, local expansion/contraction) to allow a spacecraft to traverse distances in less time than light would in unmodified spacetime. The approach leverages advances in high-energy lasers, superconducting magnets, and precision mass distribution to manipulate spacetime curvature within realistic technological and budgetary constraints.</p>
