                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Load Threshold Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by the balance between the local proteostatic load (the sum of misfolded or aggregation-prone proteins) and the intrinsic capacity of neurons and their environment to clear or buffer these proteins. When the proteostatic load exceeds a critical threshold, aggregation and toxicity ensue, leading to selective degeneration.</p>
