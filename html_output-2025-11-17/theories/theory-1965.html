                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Variable Discovery in LLM-Distilled Qualitative Laws</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when exposed to large and diverse scholarly corpora, can infer the existence of latent (unobserved) variables that explain observed regularities and exceptions in qualitative laws. By abstracting over patterns of exceptions and context-dependent relationships, LLMs can hypothesize the presence of hidden factors, leading to more nuanced and explanatory qualitative laws.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have been shown to hypothesize unobserved causes or mediators when prompted with patterns of exceptions or context-dependent relationships. </li>
    <li>In scientific question answering, LLMs often propose plausible hidden factors to explain anomalies. </li>
    <li>LLMs trained on diverse scientific literature can identify context-dependent rules and propose additional variables to account for observed deviations. </li>
    <li>Prompting LLMs with contradictory or anomalous findings often results in the model suggesting possible unmeasured confounders. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While LLMs' ability to generate explanations is established, the systematic and law-like inference of latent variables for law distillation is a novel, formalized claim.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs can hypothesize explanations for exceptions and anomalies, and are capable of abductive reasoning in scientific contexts.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit law that LLMs systematically infer latent variables for the purpose of distilling more generalizable qualitative laws from corpora is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will propose latent variables to explain exceptions in qualitative laws when exposed to corpora with systematic anomalies.</li>
                <li>LLMs will generate more nuanced qualitative laws that account for context-dependent relationships.</li>
                <li>When prompted with a set of scientific findings that include outliers, LLMs will suggest possible hidden factors or mediators.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover genuinely novel latent variables that have not been previously hypothesized in the literature.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to suggest experimental tests for the existence of inferred latent variables.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify latent variables that are not only plausible but also empirically verifiable, leading to new scientific discoveries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to hypothesize latent variables in the presence of systematic exceptions, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only restate observed patterns without proposing explanations for anomalies, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently generate spurious or irrelevant latent variables that do not improve explanatory power, the theory's utility is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The accuracy and scientific validity of LLM-inferred latent variables is not fully established; LLMs may generate plausible but incorrect explanations. </li>
    <li>LLMs may be limited by the biases and gaps present in their training data, potentially missing important latent variables. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to explanation generation and abductive reasoning, the systematic, law-like inference of latent variables for qualitative law distillation is a novel formalization.</p>
