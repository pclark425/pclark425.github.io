                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) equipped with multi-modal alignment capabilities can optimize molecular structures in a latent space by aligning textual property specifications with molecular representations. Through this alignment, LLMs can synthesize novel chemicals tailored to specific applications by interpreting natural language prompts and traversing the molecular latent space to generate candidate molecules with desired properties.</p>
