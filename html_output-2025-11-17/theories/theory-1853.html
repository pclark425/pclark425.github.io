                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epistemic Alignment Theory for LLM Scientific Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of large language models (LLMs) to accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries is fundamentally determined by the degree of epistemic alignment between the LLM's internal knowledge representation and the evolving structure of the scientific community's collective knowledge. When the LLM's learned representations, priors, and reasoning patterns are well-aligned with the latent structure of ongoing scientific debates, evidence, and methodologies, the LLM can generate probability estimates that closely track real-world likelihoods. Misalignment, due to outdated, incomplete, or biased training data, leads to systematic errors in probability estimation.</p>
