                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Constraint Propagation in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) develop emergent mechanisms for propagating and enforcing spatial constraints when solving puzzle games like Sudoku. Rather than explicitly representing rules, LLMs implicitly encode constraint satisfaction through distributed representations and token interactions, enabling them to maintain and update possible value assignments across the puzzle grid.</p>
