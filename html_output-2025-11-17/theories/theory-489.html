                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal Traceability and Verification Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the ability of language models to perform strict logical reasoning is fundamentally linked to the causal traceability of their reasoning process and the presence of explicit verification mechanisms. When models are forced to generate stepwise, causally-connected reasoning traces and these traces are subject to explicit verification (either by a value function, external verifier, or symbolic solver), the models achieve higher faithfulness, robustness to distractors, and generalization to deeper reasoning chains. The theory further claims that reasoning processes that lack causal traceability (e.g., direct input-output mapping, or unstructured chain-of-thought) are more prone to hallucination, error propagation, and failure on out-of-distribution or adversarial cases.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new reasoning system is designed to output explicit, stepwise traces and includes a verification module (e.g., value function, external solver), it will show lower hallucination rates and higher accuracy on deep logical reasoning tasks than a system without such features.</li>
                <li>If a model is evaluated on a new adversarial or distractor-rich logical reasoning benchmark, those with explicit traceability and verification will show smaller performance drops than those without.</li>
                <li>If a system is forced to output traces that can be independently checked (e.g., by a symbolic verifier), its error rate on multi-step reasoning will be lower than a system that outputs only final answers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained end-to-end to generate both traces and answers, but the traces are not explicitly verified, it is unclear whether the model will learn to produce faithful traces or simply optimize for answer accuracy.</li>
                <li>If a model is forced to generate traces in ambiguous or underspecified domains, it is unknown whether traceability will still confer robustness or if new forms of hallucination will emerge.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained to generate traces but the verification module is noisy or unreliable, it is unclear whether overall accuracy will improve or degrade.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model with explicit traceability and verification is shown to hallucinate or propagate errors at rates similar to or higher than a monolithic model, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If a model without explicit traceability or verification achieves equal or better accuracy and robustness on deep or adversarial logical reasoning tasks, the theory's claims would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If explicit verification modules are shown to have no effect or a negative effect on final answer accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some models (e.g., RuleTakers, RoBERTa) achieve high accuracy on synthetic rulebase tasks without explicit traceability or verification, possibly due to dataset simplicity or bias. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3525.html#e3525.1" class="evidence-link">[e3525.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3525.html#e3525.2" class="evidence-link">[e3525.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Instruction tuning and data augmentation (e.g., AMR-LDA, LogicLLM) can improve logical reasoning in LLMs without explicit traceability or verification. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3425.html#e3425.6" class="evidence-link">[e3425.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3434.html#e3434.0" class="evidence-link">[e3434.0]</a> </li>
