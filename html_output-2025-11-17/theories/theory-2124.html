                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Iterative Abstraction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill scientific theories from large corpora by iteratively abstracting over extracted findings, methods, and claims, forming increasingly generalizable and predictive models. The process involves LLMs identifying patterns, causal relationships, and recurring variables, then synthesizing these into higher-level laws or frameworks that explain and predict phenomena within a given topic.</p>
