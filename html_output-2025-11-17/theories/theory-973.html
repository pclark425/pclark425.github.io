                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents equipped with hierarchical memory architectures—organizing memory at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g., raw events, summarized episodes, and high-level schemas)—can efficiently generalize across diverse text game tasks. Hierarchical abstraction allows agents to compress, retrieve, and recombine knowledge at the appropriate granularity for the current reasoning demand.</p>

    <li>Hierarchical RL and memory architectures improve sample efficiency and generalization in AI. </li>
    <li>Hierarchical memory enables humans to reason over both fine-grained and abstracted representations, facilitating transfer to novel but structurally similar tasks. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Hierarchical memory is known in other domains, but its systematic application to LLM text game agents is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hierarchical memory and abstraction are studied in cognitive science and RL, but not widely in LLMs for text games.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit application of hierarchical memory abstraction to LLM agents for text games, with predictions about multi-scale reasoning and generalization, is novel.</p>
