                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Contextual Modulation Theory of Functional Stable Coactivation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the functional individuation of concepts is not only determined by stable coactivation of features, but also by the dynamic modulation of these patterns according to context. A concept is individuated if its core coactivation pattern remains stable across a range of relevant contexts, but can be flexibly modulated by contextual inputs without losing its core identity. This allows for both stability and adaptability in conceptual representation.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows that concept representations are modulated by context but retain a core pattern (e.g., Yee & Thompson-Schill, 2016). </li>
    <li>Behavioral studies show context effects on concept access, but core meaning is preserved (e.g., polysemy literature). </li>
    <li>Computational models (e.g., context-sensitive embeddings) show stable core representations with contextual modulation. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While context effects are known, the explicit individuation criterion based on core pattern stability under modulation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Contextual modulation of conceptual representations is well-documented in cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the requirement that core stability must be preserved under contextual modulation for individuation.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Concepts with core patterns that are not preserved under contextual modulation will be less reliably individuated.</li>
                <li>Training that enhances the stability of core patterns under context will improve concept discrimination.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Some concepts may lack a stable core pattern, especially in highly abstract or context-dependent domains.</li>
                <li>Artificial systems using this criterion may develop contextually fluid, non-human-like concepts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts can be individuated without a stable core pattern under contextual modulation, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If context modulation destroys core pattern identity but individuation persists, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify mechanisms for identifying or extracting the core pattern from modulated patterns. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law synthesizes context and stability requirements for individuation, which is not formalized in prior work.</p>
