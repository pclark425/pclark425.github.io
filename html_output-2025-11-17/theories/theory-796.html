                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Layered and Dynamic Memory Architecture Theory for LLM Agents (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model (LLM) agents achieve optimal task performance by employing a layered memory architecture, where different memory types (short-term, episodic, semantic, and procedural) are dynamically allocated and updated based on task demands, context, and agent goals. The architecture enables efficient retrieval, abstraction, and forgetting, allowing agents to balance context sensitivity with generalization and avoid memory overload or interference.</p>

    <li>Memory-augmented neural networks (e.g., Neural Turing Machines, Differentiable Neural Computers) demonstrate improved performance on tasks requiring both short-term and long-term memory. </li>
