                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Vacuum Engineering as a Pathway to FTL</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the quantum vacuum is a manipulable medium whose energy density can be engineered at macroscopic scales using advanced materials and electromagnetic boundary conditions. By creating regions of negative energy density, it is possible to induce local spacetime curvature sufficient for effective FTL travel, provided that the engineering is performed within the limits of current or near-future technology and budgets.</p>
