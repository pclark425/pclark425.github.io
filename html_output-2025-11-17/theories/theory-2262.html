                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2262</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most robust when conducted through an iterative, interactive process involving both human experts and AI systems. The theory asserts that human evaluators and AI tools should alternate in critiquing, refining, and stress-testing LLM-generated theories, leveraging complementary strengths: human domain expertise and contextual judgment, and AI's capacity for large-scale consistency, novelty, and empirical mapping checks.</p>

                <li>The optimal number of human-AI critique rounds for maximal evaluation quality is unknown and may vary by domain.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-agent (human or AI) evaluation consistently outperforms iterative human-AI evaluation, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If alternating critique rounds do not improve error detection or theory quality, the alternating critique law is challenged.</li>
