                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Formatting Induces Degeneration and Output Validity Collapse: Cognitive Load Theory for LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the structure and complexity of prompt formatting directly modulate the cognitive load experienced by large language models (LLMs), analogous to human cognitive load. When prompt formatting exceeds the model's effective context management capacity—through excessive length, ambiguity, or interleaving of tasks—LLMs experience a form of 'degeneration,' manifesting as output validity collapse (e.g., hallucinations, off-task responses, or incoherence). The theory predicts that prompt clarity, modularity, and explicit task separation reduce degeneration, while overloaded or ambiguous formats increase it.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will show higher rates of hallucination and incoherence when given prompts with interleaved or ambiguous instructions compared to modular, clearly separated prompts.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist an optimal prompt complexity threshold for each LLM, above which degeneration increases nonlinearly.</li>
                <li>Advanced LLMs with improved context management may exhibit higher tolerance to prompt complexity before degeneration occurs.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show increased degeneration with more complex or ambiguous prompts, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If modular prompt formatting does not reduce degeneration, the law would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs handle highly complex prompts without degeneration, possibly due to emergent abilities or training on complex data. </li>
