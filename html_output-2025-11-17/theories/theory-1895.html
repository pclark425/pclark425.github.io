                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1895</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as a High-Dimensional Control Signal Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the format of a prompt acts as a high-dimensional control signal that modulates the internal computation pathways of large language models (LLMs). The structure, explicitness, and organization of the prompt format dynamically influence the activation patterns, attention allocation, and memory utilization within the LLM, thereby shaping the model's reasoning strategies, error profiles, and output fidelity. The prompt format thus serves not merely as an input container, but as a computational directive that can steer the LLM's internal state and processing trajectory in a task-dependent manner.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt format is optimized for a specific task (e.g., using a table for retrieval), LLM performance will increase compared to a generic format.</li>
                <li>If the same information is presented in different formats, the LLM will exhibit different attention and reasoning patterns, observable via attention maps or intermediate activations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a novel, high-dimensional prompt format is introduced (e.g., multi-modal or hierarchical), the LLM may develop emergent reasoning strategies not seen with standard formats.</li>
                <li>If prompt format is adversarially manipulated, the LLM may be steered into suboptimal or unexpected computation pathways, potentially revealing new failure modes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs show no change in internal computation or output when prompt format is varied, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If task-optimized prompt formats do not improve performance or alter reasoning strategies, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of prompt format on LLMs with explicit external memory or retrieval-augmented architectures is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory reframes prompt format as a dynamic, high-dimensional control signal, which is not present in existing literature.</p>
