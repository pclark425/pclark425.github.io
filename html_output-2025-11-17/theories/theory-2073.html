                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Enabled Iterative Symbolic Law Discovery via Program Synthesis and Simulation Feedback</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when provided with large corpora of scholarly papers, can iteratively distill symbolic, quantitative scientific laws by synthesizing candidate programs (symbolic expressions), simulating their predictions, and refining them based on feedback from simulation-observation discrepancies. The process leverages the LLM's ability to parse, abstract, and recombine scientific knowledge, and is guided by a closed feedback loop between symbolic law generation and empirical validation.</p>
