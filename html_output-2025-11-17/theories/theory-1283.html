                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Expressivity-Compression Tradeoff Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that there is a fundamental tradeoff between the expressivity of a graph-to-text representation (its ability to capture all relevant graph properties) and its compression (the brevity and efficiency of the text). The ideal representation for language model training balances these, maximizing the retention of structural information while minimizing redundancy and unnecessary verbosity, thus preserving inductive bias without overwhelming the model with irrelevant detail.</p>
