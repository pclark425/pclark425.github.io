                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Chain-of-Thought and Domain-Knowledge Prompting Enhances LLM Interpretability and Anomaly-Type Classification</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and explicit domain knowledge, can not only detect anomalies in lists of data but also provide interpretable rationales and classify the type of anomaly (point, contextual, collective). The synergy between CoT and domain-specific rules enables LLMs to reason over complex dependencies and patterns, improving both detection accuracy and interpretability.</p>
