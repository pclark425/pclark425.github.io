                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1295</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Motif Aggregation Theory for Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that ideal graph-to-text representations for language model training should not only encode local motifs but also aggregate them hierarchically, capturing both local and meso-scale structure. By representing graphs as compositions of motifs at multiple scales, language models can more effectively learn both local and global properties, leading to improved performance on a wider range of hard graph problems.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Encoding very deep motif hierarchies may lead to diminishing returns or overfitting in language models.</li>
