                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs can detect anomalies in lists by leveraging their ability to generalize and transfer knowledge across domains, allowing them to identify items that do not fit learned patterns, even in unfamiliar or cross-domain contexts.</p>
