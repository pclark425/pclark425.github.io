                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Architecture Principle for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal performance of LLM agents in text games is achieved by integrating both episodic (event-sequence) and semantic (fact/knowledge) memory systems, with dynamic routing and prioritization mechanisms that adaptively select, update, and retrieve information based on task demands, context, and agent goals. The hybrid architecture enables agents to balance the need for detailed recall of past events with the abstraction and generalization required for efficient reasoning and planning.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If agents with only one type of memory (episodic or semantic) perform as well as hybrid agents on complex text games, the theory would be challenged.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to resolve conflicts between episodic and semantic memory (e.g., when they disagree). </li>
