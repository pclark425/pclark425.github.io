                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that strong, nonlinear electromagnetic fields, when arranged in specific topologies, can couple to spacetime curvature via the Einstein-Maxwell equations, enabling the formation of a positive-energy warp bubble. The theory asserts that, by using high-intensity field generators and advanced field-shaping techniques, it is possible to induce the required spacetime geometry for FTL travel within realistic energy budgets.</p>
