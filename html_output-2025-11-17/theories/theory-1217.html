                <p><strong>Name:</strong> In-Context and Retrieval-Augmented LLMs as Generalizable Molecular Generators</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when provided with in-context examples and/or retrieval-augmented memory, can generalize beyond their training distribution to generate chemically valid and application-relevant molecules, even for chemical classes not explicitly seen during training. The LLM leverages abstracted chemical syntax, functional group patterns, and application-driven prompts to synthesize novel molecules tailored to specific tasks.</p>
