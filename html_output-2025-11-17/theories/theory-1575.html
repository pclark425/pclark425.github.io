                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1575</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metric Engineering for FTL Travel</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) travel can be achieved by locally manipulating spacetime metrics using advanced but plausible energy and matter configurations. By contracting spacetime in front of a spacecraft and expanding it behind, a 'warp bubble' can be created, allowing the craft to effectively move faster than light relative to distant observers, while locally remaining subluminal. The theory explores how near-future advances in high-energy physics, metamaterials, and quantum field engineering could make such metric manipulation feasible within realistic budgets.</p>
