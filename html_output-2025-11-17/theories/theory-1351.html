                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective Prompting as Dynamic Search in Latent Solution Space</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that each generate-then-reflect cycle in a language model acts as a dynamic search step in the model's latent solution space. Reflection prompts induce the model to explore alternative reasoning paths, prune implausible or inconsistent answers, and iteratively move toward higher-probability or more coherent solutions. The process is analogous to a guided search or optimization in a high-dimensional space, where each reflection acts as a local update based on the model's own evaluation of prior outputs.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is prompted to reflect multiple times, the diversity of intermediate solutions will increase before converging on a final answer.</li>
                <li>Reflection will be most beneficial on tasks with multiple plausible reasoning paths, as the model can explore and select among them.</li>
                <li>If the reflection prompt is designed to explicitly encourage diversity, the model will generate a wider range of solutions before selection.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the latent solution space is explicitly mapped (e.g., via model probing), reflection steps will correspond to measurable transitions between solution clusters.</li>
                <li>If models are trained with explicit search objectives in latent space, the efficiency and quality of reflection-induced improvement may increase.</li>
                <li>If reflection is combined with external search algorithms (e.g., MCTS), performance may surpass that of either approach alone.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection does not increase solution diversity or does not lead to improved selection, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If models cannot prune inconsistent reasoning paths even with reflection, the analogy to search and selection would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If reflection leads to random or regressive changes rather than directed improvement, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection leads to convergence on incorrect or hallucinated solutions are not fully explained. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
