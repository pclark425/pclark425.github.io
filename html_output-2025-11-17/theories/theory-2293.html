                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Dysfunction Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the breakdown of large-scale brain network integrity, driven by a convergence of molecular, cellular, and systemic factors. Rather than a single causative agent (e.g., amyloid or tau), the disease is initiated and propagated by the failure of homeostatic mechanisms that maintain network connectivity, synaptic resilience, and neuroimmune balance. This breakdown is detectable through multimodal biomarkers reflecting network-level dysfunction before overt neurodegeneration.</p>
