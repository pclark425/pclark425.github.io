                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Scientific Trajectory Modeling</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs implicitly model the latent trajectories of scientific progress by learning patterns of hypothesis generation, validation, and adoption from historical scientific literature. By recognizing analogies, gaps, and trends in the evolution of scientific fields, LLMs can extrapolate the likelihood of future discoveries, even in the absence of explicit discourse.</p>
