                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal conversion of graphs into text for language model training must preserve both the structural properties of the original graph and the inductive biases inherent to the graph domain. The theory asserts that representations which maintain explicit, lossless mappings of graph topology and semantics into text will enable language models to learn and generalize graph-structured reasoning, while minimizing the introduction of spurious biases or information loss.</p>
