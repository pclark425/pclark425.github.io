                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Knowledge Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs' ability to estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries depends on their capacity to integrate contextual knowledge from both explicit prompt information and implicit domain priors. The theory asserts that LLMs synthesize background knowledge, recent trends, and prompt cues to generate probabilistic forecasts, and that the richness and recency of contextual information directly modulate the accuracy and calibration of these estimates.</p>
