                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bilevel LLM-Simulation Theory of Quantitative Law Distillation (Iterative Abstraction-Refinement Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that bilevel LLM simulation enables the iterative abstraction and refinement of quantitative laws from large scholarly corpora. The first level extracts candidate quantitative relationships from domain-specific literature, while the second level abstracts, tests, and refines these candidates for broader applicability and accuracy. The process cycles between levels, allowing the system to converge on robust, generalizable quantitative laws through repeated abstraction and empirical validation.</p>
