                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Loop Theory of LLM Self-Improvement</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can engage in a meta-cognitive loop, wherein each output is not only generated but also explicitly evaluated and critiqued by the model itself, using internal or external criteria. The feedback from this evaluation is then incorporated into the next generation, allowing the model to iteratively refine its outputs. This loop is analogous to human meta-cognition and can be formalized as a general mechanism for self-improvement in LLMs, independent of the specific task or domain.</p>
