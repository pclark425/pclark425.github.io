                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Skill Acquisition and Task Decomposition Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the effectiveness of self-reflection and iterative answer improvement in LLMs is fundamentally determined by the model's acquisition of meta-skills (such as self-critique, error diagnosis, and targeted revision) and by the explicit decomposition of complex tasks into intermediate steps that can be independently critiqued and refined. Iterative self-reflection is most effective when the model is trained (via meta-skill corpora or explicit feedback) to generate actionable feedback and when the reflection process is structured to operate on intermediate representations (e.g., reasoning steps, plans, or subproblems) rather than only on final outputs. The theory predicts that models with explicit meta-skill training and pipelines that decompose tasks into verifiable substeps will outperform those relying on end-to-end or global self-reflection.</p>
