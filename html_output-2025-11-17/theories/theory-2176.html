                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Guided Rule Extraction and Empirical Validation for Scientific Prediction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs can systematically extract candidate scientific rules from large corpora of scholarly papers, guided by explicit queries or topics, and that these rules can be prioritized and validated through empirical data. The process involves iterative refinement, where LLMs not only extract and summarize rules but also propose experimental or observational tests, creating a feedback loop that improves both the quality of extracted rules and their predictive power.</p>
