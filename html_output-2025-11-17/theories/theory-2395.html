                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Connectivity and Network Topology Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position within local and global cortical networks. Neurons with high connectivity (hubs), extensive long-range projections, or centrality in network topology are more exposed to pathogenic protein spread via trans-synaptic mechanisms, while sparsely connected or peripherally located neurons are more resistant.</p>
