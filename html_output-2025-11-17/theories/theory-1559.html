                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1559</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metric Engineering for FTL Travel</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) travel can be achieved by engineering the local spacetime metric around a spacecraft using currently accessible or near-future technologies. By manipulating spacetime geometry—either by contracting space in front of the craft and expanding it behind (as in the Alcubierre drive) or by creating transient, localized metric distortions—an effective FTL trajectory is possible without locally exceeding the speed of light. The theory emphasizes practical, energy-efficient approaches that could be realized within realistic budgets, such as leveraging high-energy electromagnetic fields, advanced metamaterials, or quantum vacuum effects.</p>
