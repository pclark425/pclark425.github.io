                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Warp Bubble Realizability via Non-Natário-Class Metric Engineering</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that faster-than-light (FTL) travel can be achieved by engineering spacetime metrics that produce positive-energy warp bubbles, specifically by constructing solutions outside the Natário class (which are typically associated with negative energy requirements). The theory posits that by leveraging advanced field manipulation, metamaterials, and quantum vacuum engineering, it is possible to realize such metrics within the constraints of current or near-future technology and budgets.</p>
