                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that targeted, mission-focused instruction tuning—where a student LLM is fine-tuned on diverse, real-world inputs with task-specific outputs generated by a strong teacher LLM, and negative sampling is used to handle open-world label space—enables small LLMs to achieve robust, zero-shot open information extraction (e.g., NER) across many domains, outperforming generic instruction-tuned or supervised multi-task models. The approach is especially effective when queries are structured as natural-language label requests, and negative sampling is frequency-weighted to match real-world label distributions.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>UniNER's mission-focused instruction tuning, with negative sampling and real input diversity, yields much higher zero-shot NER F1 than Alpaca, Vicuna, or InstructUIE, and even outperforms supervised multi-task models on out-of-domain data. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.0" class="evidence-link">[e6085.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.1" class="evidence-link">[e6085.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.4" class="evidence-link">[e6085.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.9" class="evidence-link">[e6085.9]</a> </li>
    <li>Negative sampling (frequency-based) during instruction tuning significantly improves performance: average F1 53.4% (vs None 31.5% and Uniform 47.7% in the ablation on UniNER-7B), showing a large positive effect of this strategy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.4" class="evidence-link">[e6085.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Definition-based data construction increases robustness to label paraphrasing, though it reduces alignment with standard NER benchmarks, indicating the importance of label-query structure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.5" class="evidence-link">[e6085.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Generic instruction-tuned models (Alpaca, Vicuna) perform poorly at zero-shot open NER on the comprehensive benchmark; UniNER greatly outperforms these general instruction-tuned models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.0" class="evidence-link">[e6085.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.9" class="evidence-link">[e6085.9]</a> </li>
    <li>Supervised multi-task instruction-tuned models (InstructUIE) are outperformed by mission-focused UniNER on out-of-domain and open-label tasks, despite using human-labelled supervised data. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.0" class="evidence-link">[e6085.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a novel synthesis and formalization of recent empirical findings in open NER distillation, abstracted from the UniversalNER work and its ablations.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Instruction tuning and negative sampling are established, but typically applied in generic or multi-task settings, not in a mission-focused, open-extraction context.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes that mission-focused, label-query-based instruction tuning with frequency-weighted negative sampling is necessary for robust open information extraction, and that generic instruction tuning is insufficient.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying mission-focused instruction tuning with frequency-weighted negative sampling to other open extraction tasks (e.g., relation extraction, event extraction) will yield similar zero-shot robustness gains.</li>
                <li>Student LLMs tuned in this way will be more robust to label paraphrasing and open-world label drift than those trained with generic instruction tuning.</li>
                <li>Negative sampling strategies that match real-world label frequency distributions will outperform uniform or no negative sampling in open extraction tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Extending mission-focused instruction tuning to multi-modal or cross-lingual open extraction tasks may enable robust zero-shot performance in those settings.</li>
                <li>Combining mission-focused tuning with symbolic structuring (e.g., knowledge graph construction) may yield even greater gains in interpretability and robustness.</li>
                <li>Applying this approach to tasks with extremely large or dynamic label spaces (e.g., open event extraction, open relation extraction) may require further innovations (e.g., definition-based queries or hierarchical label modeling) to maintain performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If mission-focused instruction tuning with frequency-weighted negative sampling does not outperform generic instruction tuning or multi-task supervised models on open extraction tasks, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If the approach fails to generalize to new domains or label spaces (e.g., biomedical, legal, or social domains), the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If negative sampling does not improve or even harms performance in open extraction settings, the theory's mechanism is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some domains with highly ambiguous or poorly defined entity types may not benefit as much from this approach, as seen in the definition-based data variant, which increased robustness to paraphrasing but reduced benchmark alignment. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.5" class="evidence-link">[e6085.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Tasks with extremely large or dynamic label spaces may require additional mechanisms (e.g., definition-based queries) to maintain robustness, as the definition-based variant showed trade-offs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6085.html#e6085.5" class="evidence-link">[e6085.5]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a new theory, directly abstracted from recent empirical work (UniversalNER), and not previously formalized in the literature.</p>
