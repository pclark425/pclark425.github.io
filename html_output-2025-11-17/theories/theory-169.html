                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit Simulator Requirements Hypothesis (Evidence-Limited)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about minimal simulator fidelity requirements for training transferable scientific reasoning in domains such as thermodynamics, circuits, and biology, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Based on extremely limited evidence from the dataset (only brief mentions in survey papers), there is insufficient data to establish a validated theory of minimal circuit simulator fidelity requirements for transfer learning. The available evidence shows that: (1) IEEE distribution system benchmarks and MATLAB/Simulink models are used for power system RL training, and (2) physics-informed approaches incorporate physical constraints in reward design. However, no detailed studies of circuit simulator fidelity, no analog/digital/RF circuit examples, no fidelity comparisons, and no direct sim-to-real transfer experiments for circuits are present in the dataset. This represents a significant gap in the evidence base. Any requirements for circuit simulation fidelity (such as modeling of nonlinearities, parasitics, or component tolerances) remain speculative and require empirical validation.</p>

                <li>Finding that ideal (parasitic-free) circuit models enable successful transfer to real high-frequency circuits would challenge assumptions about parasitic modeling requirements</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that linear approximations of nonlinear components enable transfer would challenge assumptions about nonlinearity modeling</li>
                <li>Showing that incorrect circuit topology can be compensated by parameter tuning would challenge fundamental assumptions about simulator structure</li>
                <li>Finding that physics-agnostic (black-box) models outperform physics-informed models for circuit control would challenge the value of incorporating circuit laws</li>
