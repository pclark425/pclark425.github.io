                <li>A sufficiently large and coherent Casimir array will enable a test mass to traverse a region at an effective velocity exceeding c relative to external observers, without locally exceeding c.</li>
                <li>Macroscopic metric engineering will allow the creation of 'warp bubbles' that can be detected via gravitational lensing or time dilation signatures.</li>
                <li>Quantum instabilities or decoherence may emerge at large scales, potentially limiting the stability or duration of engineered regions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Failure to detect any metric deviation in large-scale Casimir arrays would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If energy requirements for metric engineering scale prohibitively (e.g., exponentially with size), practical FTL would be ruled out.</li>
                <li>If attempts to aggregate Casimir effects in arrays do not produce cumulative metric distortions, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>No direct evidence yet exists for macroscopic metric engineering via Casimir or vacuum effects. </li>
    <li>The stability of engineered metric regions over time and under real-world conditions is not addressed by current theory. </li>
