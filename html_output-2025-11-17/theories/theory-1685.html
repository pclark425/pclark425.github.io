                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1685</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Simulation Complexity Threshold Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as simulators in scientific subdomains is governed by a complexity threshold: LLMs can accurately simulate phenomena up to a certain level of conceptual, procedural, or combinatorial complexity, beyond which their performance degrades sharply. This threshold is determined by the interplay of model capacity, training data diversity, and the inherent complexity of the subdomain's knowledge structures.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing model size or training data diversity will raise the complexity threshold for accurate simulation.</li>
                <li>Tasks just above the threshold will show the most rapid accuracy degradation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Architectural innovations (e.g., modularity, explicit memory) may allow LLMs to surpass current complexity thresholds.</li>
                <li>Hybrid systems combining LLMs with symbolic reasoning may exhibit higher thresholds.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs maintain high accuracy on tasks far above their estimated complexity threshold, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If accuracy degrades gradually rather than sharply at the threshold, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs may solve super-threshold tasks via memorization or shortcut heuristics. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
