                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memory Modality-Task Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents can use memory to help solve text games.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal performance in text games requires alignment between memory modality and task characteristics. Different memory modalities—episodic (sequential event traces), semantic (structured knowledge graphs), working (short-term context), and procedural (action patterns)—are each optimally suited for different task types. Episodic memory excels at tasks requiring temporal reasoning and causal chains; semantic memory excels at tasks requiring world knowledge and entity relationships; working memory excels at tasks requiring immediate context tracking; and procedural memory excels at tasks requiring learned action sequences. The theory predicts that: (1) performance degrades when memory modality is misaligned with task demands, (2) task characteristics can be analyzed to predict optimal memory modality, and (3) adaptive systems that dynamically select memory modalities based on task features will outperform fixed-modality systems. This represents a novel framework for understanding how memory architecture should be matched to task structure in interactive text environments.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Tasks requiring temporal reasoning and causal chains (e.g., multi-step puzzles with delayed consequences) achieve optimal performance with episodic memory that preserves sequential event structure.</li>
                <li>Tasks requiring world knowledge and entity relationships (e.g., understanding object properties, spatial layouts, character relationships) achieve optimal performance with semantic memory organized as knowledge graphs or structured representations.</li>
                <li>Tasks requiring immediate context tracking (e.g., following conversation threads, tracking inventory changes) achieve optimal performance with working memory that maintains recent observations.</li>
                <li>Tasks requiring learned action sequences and skill execution (e.g., combat patterns, navigation routines) achieve optimal performance with procedural memory that encodes action policies.</li>
                <li>Performance degradation occurs when memory modality is misaligned with task demands—for example, using only working memory for tasks requiring long-term causal reasoning, or using only episodic memory for tasks requiring structured world knowledge.</li>
                <li>Task characteristics such as temporal dependency length, knowledge complexity, action space size, and state observability can be used to predict which memory modality will be most effective.</li>
                <li>Hybrid memory architectures that combine multiple modalities and dynamically allocate attention based on task features will outperform single-modality systems across diverse text game tasks.</li>
                <li>The degree of alignment between memory modality and task type correlates with learning efficiency, sample efficiency, and final performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Episodic memory systems that track action sequences and their outcomes improve agent learning in text games with sparse rewards and delayed consequences, suggesting episodic memory aligns well with temporal reasoning tasks. </li>
    <li>Knowledge graph representations (semantic memory) improve performance in text games requiring understanding of object properties and relationships, suggesting semantic memory aligns with knowledge-intensive tasks. </li>
    <li>Agents using recurrent architectures (working memory) that maintain short-term context show improved performance in tasks requiring tracking of immediate state changes. </li>
    <li>Action elimination mechanisms (procedural memory for failed actions) improve efficiency by learning which action patterns to avoid, suggesting procedural memory aligns with action selection tasks. </li>
    <li>Different text game genres place different cognitive demands on agents, implying that task characteristics vary systematically and may require different memory approaches. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In puzzle games requiring multi-step causal reasoning (e.g., Zork, Detective games), agents with episodic memory will achieve 40-60% higher success rates than agents with only semantic or working memory.</li>
                <li>In knowledge-intensive games requiring understanding of object properties and relationships (e.g., cooking games, crafting games), agents with semantic memory (knowledge graphs) will achieve 30-50% higher success rates than agents with only episodic memory.</li>
                <li>In dialogue-heavy games requiring tracking of conversation context, agents with working memory will show 25-40% better performance than agents relying primarily on episodic or semantic memory.</li>
                <li>Hybrid systems that can switch between memory modalities based on task phase (e.g., using semantic memory for exploration, episodic memory for puzzle-solving) will outperform fixed-modality systems by 20-35% across diverse game types.</li>
                <li>Analysis of task characteristics (temporal dependency length, knowledge graph complexity, dialogue density) will predict optimal memory modality with 70-85% accuracy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal ratio for allocating memory capacity across different modalities in hybrid systems is unknown and could reveal fundamental architectural principles.</li>
                <li>The extent to which memory modality preferences transfer across different text game genres (e.g., whether episodic memory advantages in detective games transfer to science fiction puzzle games) is unknown.</li>
                <li>Whether certain task types require novel memory modalities not yet identified (beyond episodic, semantic, working, and procedural) is unknown and could expand the theoretical framework.</li>
                <li>How memory modality alignment interacts with other architectural choices (e.g., attention mechanisms, language model size) is unknown and could reveal important interaction effects.</li>
                <li>Whether human players naturally employ different memory strategies aligned with task types, and whether this alignment matches the predicted optimal modalities for AI agents, is unknown and could validate or challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a single memory modality (e.g., only episodic or only semantic) performs equally well across all task types, this would challenge the core alignment hypothesis.</li>
                <li>If task characteristics cannot predict optimal memory modality better than random selection, this would challenge the theory's predictive framework.</li>
                <li>If hybrid systems that dynamically select memory modalities perform no better than fixed single-modality systems, this would challenge the practical value of the alignment principle.</li>
                <li>If memory modality has no measurable effect on performance when controlling for model capacity and training time, this would challenge the theory's fundamental premise.</li>
                <li>If agents using 'misaligned' memory modalities (e.g., only working memory for long-term causal reasoning tasks) can achieve comparable performance through sufficient training, this would challenge the efficiency claims of the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to optimally combine multiple memory modalities in hybrid systems—whether through parallel processing, sequential switching, or hierarchical organization—is not fully specified by the theory. </li>
    <li>The computational and memory costs of maintaining multiple memory modalities simultaneously, and whether these costs outweigh the performance benefits, are not addressed. </li>
    <li>How memory modality requirements change as agents become more experienced in a game (e.g., whether procedural memory becomes more important after initial exploration) is not specified. </li>
    <li>The granularity at which task characteristics should be analyzed (game-level, episode-level, or step-level) to determine optimal memory modality is not clearly defined. </li>
    <li>How to handle tasks that simultaneously require multiple memory modalities (e.g., a puzzle requiring both causal reasoning and world knowledge) is not fully addressed. </li>
