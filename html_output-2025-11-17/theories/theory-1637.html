                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1637</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Interactive Feedback Loop Theory of LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is not static, but dynamically evolves through interactive feedback loops with users or external evaluators. Iterative correction, clarification, and reinforcement learning from human or automated feedback can drive LLMs toward higher simulation accuracy, even in initially unfamiliar subdomains.</p>
