                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2192</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Feedback Alignment Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is a dynamic, iterative process in which feedback from multiple evaluators (human and automated) is used to realign the theory along key dimensions. The process is not static: as new evidence, critiques, or perspectives emerge, the alignment of the theory is updated, and the evaluation outcome can change over time.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Scientific theories are often revised in response to peer review and new evidence (Kuhn, 1962; Langley et al., 1987). </li>
    <li>LLM-generated outputs can be improved through iterative prompting and feedback (Ziegler et al., 2019). </li>
    <li>Human-in-the-loop evaluation and revision cycles are standard in both science and LLM development. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The iterative feedback process is known, but its formalization for LLM-generated theory evaluation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Iterative feedback and revision are standard in scientific practice and LLM fine-tuning.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Applying this as a formal law for the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is new.</p>
