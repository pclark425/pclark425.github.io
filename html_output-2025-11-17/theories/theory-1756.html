                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Language Model Statistical Deviation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can detect anomalies in lists of data by modeling the statistical regularities and semantic patterns present in the data, and flagging items that deviate significantly from these learned distributions. The LLM acts as a high-dimensional, context-aware estimator of 'normality', leveraging both explicit statistical features and implicit semantic knowledge.</p>

                <li>If a list is composed of highly technical jargon outside the LLM's training distribution, the model may fail to detect anomalies or may flag normal items as anomalous.</li>
