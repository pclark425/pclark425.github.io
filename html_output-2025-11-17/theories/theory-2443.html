                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection-Dependent Vulnerability Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is determined by their network connectivity patterns and the nature of their long-range projections. Specifically, neurons with extensive, integrative, or hub-like connectivity, or those projecting to regions with high amyloid/tau burden, are more susceptible to pathology, while neurons with local, modular, or isolated connectivity are more resistant.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the hubness of a visual cortex population (e.g., via optogenetic stimulation or synaptic plasticity) will increase its vulnerability to amyloid/tau pathology in animal models.</li>
                <li>Disrupting long-range projections from visual cortex to pathology-rich regions will reduce vulnerability of those neurons to amyloid/tau accumulation.</li>
                <li>Selective enhancement of local connectivity in visual cortex neurons will confer resistance to amyloid/tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If visual cortex neurons with high hubness or projections to pathology-rich regions do not show increased pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If neurons with only local connectivity are equally vulnerable as hub neurons, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If severing projections to pathology-rich regions does not reduce vulnerability, the projection-dependence aspect of the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cell-intrinsic factors such as gene expression profiles or metabolic state may also contribute to vulnerability, independent of connectivity. </li>
    <li>Microglial or astrocytic responses may modulate vulnerability in ways not directly related to network connectivity. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
