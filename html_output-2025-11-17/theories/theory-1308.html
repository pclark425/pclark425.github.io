                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1308</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Alignment Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for language model training is one that maximally preserves and aligns the semantic content and relational structure of the original graph within the generated text. The theory asserts that representations which encode both explicit graph topology and implicit semantic roles enable language models to better learn, generalize, and reason over graph-structured data.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Language models trained on text that encodes both graph structure and semantics will outperform those trained on structureless or semantics-poor text in graph-based reasoning tasks.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For highly dense or cyclic graphs, the optimal balance between structural and semantic encoding in text may shift, potentially requiring new hybrid representations.</li>
                <li>There may exist a threshold of structural complexity beyond which further explicit encoding in text yields diminishing returns for LM training.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LMs trained on text that omits graph structure or semantics perform equally well as those with full encoding, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If explicit relation encoding in text does not improve LM inference of graph relationships, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle graphs with ambiguous or context-dependent semantics. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address the trade-off between text length and information density in encoding large graphs. </li>
