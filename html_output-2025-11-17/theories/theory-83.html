                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about hybrid declarative-imperative reasoning systems and their emergent properties, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hybrid declarative-imperative reasoning systems achieve superior performance by exploiting complementary strengths: declarative (symbolic) components provide structured knowledge, logical consistency, interpretability, compositional generalization, and explicit reasoning traces, while imperative (neural) components provide robust pattern recognition, handling of noisy/incomplete data, learning from examples, and perceptual grounding. The degree of performance improvement correlates with: (1) how well the integration method allows bidirectional information flow and mutual constraint satisfaction between components, (2) the alignment between symbolic knowledge domain and task requirements, (3) the complementarity of capabilities (tasks requiring both perception and reasoning benefit most), and (4) the granularity of integration (tighter integration generally improves complex reasoning but increases training complexity). However, this advantage diminishes when: symbolic knowledge is misaligned with the task, neural models reach sufficient scale to exhibit emergent reasoning, or integration overhead exceeds complementarity benefits.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Hybrid systems that allow bidirectional information flow between declarative and imperative components achieve better performance than unidirectional or loosely-coupled systems on tasks requiring both perception and reasoning.</li>
                <li>The performance gain from hybridization is proportional to: (a) the degree of complementarity between symbolic and neural capabilities on the target task, (b) the alignment between symbolic knowledge domain and task requirements, and (c) the quality of the integration mechanism.</li>
                <li>Systems with tighter integration (e.g., end-to-end differentiable, joint message passing, unified working graphs) show better performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks than modular pipelines, but require more sophisticated training procedures and may sacrifice some interpretability.</li>
                <li>Declarative components provide systematic compositional generalization, interpretability through explicit reasoning traces, and logical consistency, while imperative components provide robustness to noise, ability to learn from examples, and perceptual grounding.</li>
                <li>The optimal integration method depends on task characteristics: perception-heavy tasks benefit from neural-to-symbolic pipelines (Neuro|Symbolic), reasoning-heavy tasks benefit from symbolic-to-neural architectures (Symbolic|Neuro), and tasks requiring tight coupling benefit from joint architectures (Neuro[Symbolic] or Symbolic[Neuro]).</li>
                <li>Hybrid advantages diminish when: (a) symbolic knowledge is misaligned with task domain, (b) neural models reach sufficient scale to exhibit emergent reasoning capabilities, (c) integration overhead (computational, memory, training complexity) exceeds complementarity benefits, or (d) tasks can be solved effectively by either component alone.</li>
                <li>Integration granularity matters: token-level or attention-based integration enables finer-grained interaction but increases complexity, while module-level integration is simpler but may miss opportunities for mutual constraint satisfaction.</li>
                <li>Hybrid systems show better sample efficiency and data-efficient learning when symbolic components provide strong inductive biases that align with task structure.</li>
                <li>The interpretability advantage of hybrid systems depends on maintaining explicit symbolic representations and reasoning traces; systems that compile symbolic knowledge into opaque neural weights lose this benefit.</li>

                <li>Hybrid systems with explicit symbolic memory structures (e.g., knowledge graphs, working memory) will show better few-shot learning performance compared to pure neural approaches on tasks requiring compositional generalization, with the advantage increasing as the number of composition steps increases.</li>
                <li>Systems that allow symbolic components to query neural components for uncertain predicates (e.g., probabilistic logic programming with neural predicates) will handle incomplete knowledge bases more robustly than pure symbolic reasoners, maintaining high precision while improving recall.</li>
                <li>Hybrid architectures with explicit compositional structure (e.g., neural module networks, program synthesis) will show better length generalization on sequence tasks than pure neural sequence models, with performance degrading more gracefully as sequence length increases beyond training distribution.</li>
                <li>Integrating symbolic temporal logic constraints into neural policy learning for sequential decision-making will improve safety and constraint satisfaction compared to pure reinforcement learning, while maintaining adaptability to novel situations.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether hybrid systems can achieve human-level performance on the full ARC benchmark (currently best hybrid: 78.8%) by combining program synthesis with neural perception and meta-learning, or whether the diversity of abstraction types in ARC requires fundamentally different approaches.</li>
                <li>Whether bidirectional integration between large language models and symbolic knowledge graphs can achieve near-perfect accuracy (>95%) on complex multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring both commonsense and factual knowledge, or whether the brittleness of symbolic components will limit performance in open-domain settings.</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid systems can learn to automatically discover and represent new symbolic abstractions from neural observations without human-specified symbolic vocabularies, enabling open-ended learning of compositional concepts.</li>
                <li>Whether tightly-integrated hybrid systems can maintain the interpretability advantages of symbolic components while achieving the robustness of neural components in real-world deployment, or whether there is a fundamental trade-off between integration tightness and interpretability.</li>
                <li>Whether the performance gap between hybrid and pure neural approaches will continue to widen, narrow, or remain constant as neural model scale increases beyond current state-of-the-art (e.g., >1T parameters), and whether emergent reasoning capabilities in very large models will reduce or eliminate the need for explicit symbolic components.</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid systems can achieve better adversarial robustness than pure neural systems by using symbolic components to verify consistency and detect out-of-distribution inputs, or whether adversarial examples will exploit the integration interface between components.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Finding tasks where loosely-coupled hybrid systems consistently outperform tightly-integrated ones across multiple domains would challenge the bidirectional information flow principle and suggest that integration overhead can outweigh benefits.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that pure neural systems can achieve equivalent compositional generalization to hybrid systems on symbolic reasoning tasks (e.g., matching NS-VQA's 99.8% on CLEVR with pure neural approaches) would question the necessity of explicit symbolic components for compositional reasoning.</li>
                <li>Showing that hybrid systems fail to outperform pure symbolic systems on tasks with complete, noise-free symbolic knowledge would challenge the complementarity principle and suggest that neural components add unnecessary complexity in well-specified domains.</li>
                <li>Finding that the performance gap between hybrid and pure neural approaches disappears or reverses as neural model scale increases (e.g., at 10T+ parameters) would suggest hybridization may be unnecessary for sufficiently large models and that emergent reasoning is sufficient.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating cases where the integration interface between symbolic and neural components becomes a bottleneck that limits performance below what either component could achieve independently would challenge the assumption that integration always provides benefits.</li>
                <li>Finding that hybrid systems show worse out-of-distribution generalization than pure neural systems on certain task types would challenge the assumption that symbolic components always improve systematic generalization.</li>
                <li>Showing that the interpretability of hybrid systems is not significantly better than pure neural systems in practice (e.g., due to complex integration mechanisms or learned symbolic representations) would question one of the key claimed advantages of hybridization.</li>
