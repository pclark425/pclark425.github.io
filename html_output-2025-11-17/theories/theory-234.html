                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multimodal Alignment as Spatial Grounding Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models encode and utilize spatial, procedural, and object-relational knowledge for embodied planning tasks without direct sensory input.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models encode and utilize spatial, procedural, and object-relational knowledge through implicit or explicit alignment with multimodal (particularly visual-spatial) representations. The theory posits that spatial grounding emerges from learned correspondences between linguistic descriptions and spatial configurations, either through: (1) direct multimodal pretraining where language and vision are jointly trained, creating shared representational spaces, or (2) indirect alignment where pure language models learn spatial relationships from rich textual descriptions of visual scenes, spatial arrangements, and physical interactions that implicitly encode visual-spatial structure. The theory suggests that this alignment creates 'pseudo-spatial' representations in language models that mirror key properties of actual spatial representations—including relative positioning, spatial extent, containment relationships, and geometric constraints. During embodied planning, language models leverage these aligned representations to simulate spatial configurations and reason about feasible actions by projecting linguistic action descriptions onto this pseudo-spatial substrate. The strength and fidelity of spatial reasoning is proportional to the degree of multimodal alignment, with explicitly multimodal models showing stronger spatial grounding than pure language models, but both benefiting from the same underlying alignment mechanism.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spatial grounding in language models emerges from alignment between linguistic descriptions and spatial/visual representations, either through direct multimodal training or indirect learning from spatially-rich text.</li>
                <li>The degree of spatial reasoning capability is proportional to the strength of multimodal alignment, with explicitly trained vision-language models showing stronger spatial grounding than pure language models.</li>
                <li>Language models develop 'pseudo-spatial' representations that preserve key relational properties of actual spatial configurations (topology, relative positioning, containment) even without direct sensory input.</li>
                <li>Spatial prepositions and relational terms serve as alignment anchors that bridge linguistic and spatial representational spaces.</li>
                <li>Embodied planning in language models operates by projecting action descriptions onto pseudo-spatial representations and evaluating consistency with learned spatial constraints.</li>
                <li>Multimodal alignment enables compositional spatial reasoning by allowing language models to combine learned spatial primitives in novel configurations.</li>
                <li>The fidelity of spatial reasoning degrades for configurations that are underrepresented in the alignment training data or that require precise metric information rather than topological relationships.</li>
                <li>Language models with stronger multimodal alignment can better transfer spatial knowledge across different linguistic descriptions of the same spatial configuration.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Vision-language models like CLIP show emergent spatial reasoning capabilities that pure language models lack, suggesting multimodal alignment provides spatial grounding. </li>
    <li>Language models trained on image captions and visual descriptions show better spatial reasoning than those trained only on non-visual text. </li>
    <li>Multimodal models can ground spatial prepositions and relationships more accurately than language-only models. </li>
    <li>Language models show representations that correlate with spatial properties when processing spatial language, suggesting implicit spatial encoding. </li>
    <li>Vision-language pretraining improves performance on embodied AI tasks requiring spatial reasoning and planning. </li>
    <li>Representations in multimodal models show alignment between linguistic spatial terms and corresponding visual spatial features. </li>
    <li>Language models can predict plausible spatial configurations and detect spatial anomalies, suggesting some form of spatial representation. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Language models with explicit vision-language pretraining will outperform pure language models on spatial reasoning benchmarks, with performance gains proportional to the amount of multimodal training.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning language models on spatially-rich textual descriptions (e.g., detailed scene descriptions, navigation instructions) will improve their spatial reasoning capabilities.</li>
                <li>Probing the internal representations of multimodal models will reveal spatial structure (e.g., representations that cluster by spatial relationships) that is absent or weaker in pure language models.</li>
                <li>Language models will show better spatial reasoning for common spatial configurations (e.g., 'cup on table') that are frequently described in vision-language training data than for rare configurations.</li>
                <li>Providing language models with explicit spatial relationship descriptions will improve planning accuracy more for pure language models than for multimodal models, as the latter already have stronger spatial grounding.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether language models can develop true metric spatial reasoning (precise distances, angles) through multimodal alignment, or whether they are limited to topological and qualitative spatial relationships.</li>
                <li>Whether the pseudo-spatial representations in language models support mental rotation and other spatial transformation operations that humans can perform.</li>
                <li>Whether multimodal alignment enables language models to reason about spatial relationships in novel sensory modalities (e.g., tactile, auditory spatial information) through transfer learning.</li>
                <li>Whether the spatial grounding from multimodal alignment is sufficient for complex multi-step spatial planning tasks, or whether it primarily supports single-step spatial reasoning.</li>
                <li>Whether language models can learn to align with spatial representations from text alone if given sufficiently rich and systematic spatial descriptions, approaching the performance of explicitly multimodal models.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If vision-language models show no advantage over pure language models on spatial reasoning tasks, this would challenge the core claim that multimodal alignment provides spatial grounding.</li>
                <li>If the internal representations of multimodal models show no spatial structure or organization, this would question whether true spatial representations are formed through alignment.</li>
                <li>If removing vision-language pretraining from a model's training does not degrade spatial reasoning performance, this would suggest multimodal alignment is not the primary mechanism for spatial grounding.</li>
                <li>If language models cannot improve spatial reasoning through exposure to spatially-rich text, this would challenge the indirect alignment pathway proposed by the theory.</li>
                <li>If multimodal models fail to transfer spatial knowledge across different linguistic descriptions of the same spatial scene, this would question the robustness of the alignment mechanism.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How language models handle spatial reasoning in domains where visual-spatial alignment is weak or absent (e.g., abstract spatial concepts, high-dimensional spaces). </li>
    <li>The specific computational mechanisms by which linguistic and spatial representations are aligned during training. </li>
    <li>How temporal dynamics and procedural knowledge (action sequences) are integrated with spatial representations. </li>
    <li>Whether different types of spatial relationships (topological, projective, metric) require different alignment mechanisms or are learned through a unified process. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
