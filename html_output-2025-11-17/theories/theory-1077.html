                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1077</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Probabilistic Simulation and Search in Language Model Puzzle Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs solve spatial puzzles like Sudoku by implicitly simulating multiple possible solution paths in parallel, using their probabilistic next-token prediction mechanism as a form of search. Rather than committing to a single solution, the model maintains a distribution over possible moves, dynamically updating this distribution as more of the puzzle is generated. This enables the model to 'hedge' its predictions, backtrack, and converge on valid solutions through iterative sampling or beam search.</p>
