                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Management and Compression Theory for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve superior performance in text games by actively managing, compressing, and prioritizing memory contents. Rather than passively storing all information, agents must learn to select, summarize, and update memory traces based on task relevance, recency, and predictive utility, thereby overcoming context window limitations and enabling long-term planning and efficient retrieval.</p>
