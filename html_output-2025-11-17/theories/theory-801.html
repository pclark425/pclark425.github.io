                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Routing Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance by employing hierarchical memory routing mechanisms, where information is selectively routed between memory modules of varying abstraction and persistence. The routing is governed by learned or adaptive policies that prioritize relevant information flow, minimize interference, and support compositional reasoning.</p>
