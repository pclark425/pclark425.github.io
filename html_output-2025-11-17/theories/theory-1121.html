                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit State Tracking Theory for Logical Consistency in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve strict logical reasoning by maintaining and updating an explicit internal representation of logical state throughout the reasoning process. The theory asserts that, for strict logical consistency, LMs must be able to represent, update, and query a structured state (e.g., a set of propositions, variable bindings, or truth assignments) as they process input and generate output, rather than relying solely on distributed, implicit representations.</p>
