                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented in a structured, compositional format, where concepts are encoded as hierarchically organized, symbolic structures that can be flexibly combined and manipulated. This compositionality enables systematic generalization, productivity, and the ability to represent novel concepts by combining known elements according to abstract rules.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The hierarchical symbolic structure is established in some domains, but its generalization to all conceptual knowledge is a novel claim.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hierarchical symbolic encoding is a core idea in classical cognitive architectures and semantic network models.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law generalizes hierarchical symbolic encoding to all conceptual knowledge, not just language or semantic memory.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel combinations of familiar concepts will be processed more efficiently than entirely novel concepts, reflecting compositional reuse.</li>
                <li>Neuroimaging will reveal hierarchical activation patterns when processing multi-level conceptual structures.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial neural networks with explicit hierarchical compositional architectures will better match human conceptual generalization than flat or distributed models.</li>
                <li>Disruption of hierarchical structure (e.g., via brain lesions) will selectively impair the ability to process complex, nested concepts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If humans cannot generalize to novel combinations of familiar concepts, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If neuroimaging fails to reveal hierarchical or compositional patterns during conceptual processing, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how compositional structures are learned or instantiated neurally. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and generalizes existing principles, but its claim of universal, functionally implemented compositionality is novel.</p>
