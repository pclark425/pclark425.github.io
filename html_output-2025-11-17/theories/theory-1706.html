                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1706</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM Pattern Induction and Deviation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, when presented with a list, induce latent patterns (syntactic, semantic, or logical) that describe the majority of items. Anomalies are detected as items that deviate from these induced patterns. Prompt engineering can enhance the LLM's ability to articulate the inferred pattern and systematically flag deviations, making the process transparent and adaptable to diverse data types.</p>
