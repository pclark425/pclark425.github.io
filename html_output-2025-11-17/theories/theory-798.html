                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-798</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Layered and Dynamic Memory Architecture Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal task-solving in LLM agents emerges from a multi-layered memory system, where each layer encodes information at different abstraction levels and timescales. The agent dynamically routes, abstracts, and updates memory traces across these layers based on task demands, recency, and relevance, enabling both detailed recall and generalization. The architecture balances short-term, context-rich memory with long-term, abstracted knowledge, and adapts memory management strategies in response to environmental feedback.</p>
