                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Text-to-Molecule Translation via Latent Space Navigation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by decomposing high-level textual requirements into hierarchical subgoals, each mapped to distinct regions of a shared latent space. By navigating this latent space through iterative refinement and constraint satisfaction, the LLM can generate molecular structures that fulfill complex, multi-faceted application criteria.</p>
