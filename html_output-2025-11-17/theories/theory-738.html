                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Algorithm Activation and Superficial Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that large language models (LLMs) perform arithmetic by activating latent algorithmic structures learned from data, but that their outputs are also shaped by superficial alignment to surface-level patterns in their training corpus. The interplay between these two processes determines both the successes and characteristic errors of LLMs on arithmetic tasks.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If arithmetic queries are presented in formats not seen during training, LLMs will be less likely to activate correct latent algorithms and more likely to rely on superficial alignment, increasing error rates.</li>
                <li>Increasing the diversity of arithmetic formats in training data will improve LLM robustness to novel arithmetic queries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit feedback on superficial alignment errors, it is unknown whether they will develop mechanisms to suppress such errors or simply shift to new error types.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are exposed to adversarial arithmetic queries that systematically exploit superficial alignment, the resulting adaptation dynamics are unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs consistently solve arithmetic queries in novel formats without increased error, the theory's emphasis on latent algorithm activation conditioned on surface pattern match would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs never produce plausible but incorrect arithmetic outputs, the role of superficial alignment would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs can self-correct arithmetic errors in multi-step reasoning, which is not fully explained by the theory. </li>
    <li>Abrupt improvements in arithmetic performance after scaling are not fully accounted for by gradual latent algorithm development. </li>
