            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover unexpected or unconventional solutions through feedback-driven exploration.</li>
                <li>Iterative feedback may enable LLMs to generalize to new chemical spaces not well represented in the training data.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If iterative feedback does not improve the quality or property satisfaction of generated molecules, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to converge or oscillate between suboptimal solutions despite feedback, the convergence law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If feedback loops lead to mode collapse or loss of molecular diversity, the theory's generality would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the impact of noisy or misleading feedback on the optimization process. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain how to balance exploration and exploitation in feedback-driven LLM generation. </li>
