                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Peer Review Convergence Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of optimal coordination, communication protocols, and feedback mechanisms between multiple specialized AI agents conducting different phases of scientific research, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Multi-agent systems employing iterative peer review with multiple rounds of critique and refinement converge to higher-quality solutions than single-pass generation across diverse task domains, but exhibit diminishing returns after 3-5 rounds and risk degradation from erroneous peer feedback, particularly with weaker models. The optimal number of review rounds depends on task complexity, agent capability, review structure, and the presence of objective evaluation criteria. Vertical (solver + reviewers) structures are more effective than horizontal (democratic) structures for tasks requiring single refined solutions, while horizontal structures excel at multi-subtask decomposition. Review effectiveness is maximized when combined with structured criteria, chain-of-thought reasoning, and objective feedback mechanisms (e.g., executable tests, formal verification).</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Iterative peer review improves solution quality by 15-35% compared to single-pass generation for complex tasks requiring refinement (e.g., code generation, specification writing, vulnerability detection)</li>
                <li>The optimal number of review rounds is typically 2-5 for most tasks, with diminishing returns beyond 5 rounds and potential degradation from accumulated errors</li>
                <li>Vertical review structures (dedicated solver + critics) outperform horizontal structures (democratic) by 10-30% for tasks requiring single refined solutions (e.g., math reasoning, code generation)</li>
                <li>Horizontal review structures outperform vertical for multi-subtask decomposition and tool-using tasks by enabling parallel subtask assignment</li>
                <li>The risk of erroneous peer feedback increases with the number of reviewers and review rounds, particularly for weaker models (GPT-3.5-Turbo shows 10% error rate from peer influence)</li>
                <li>Review effectiveness depends critically on reviewer quality; weak reviewers can degrade performance by 10-25% compared to no review</li>
                <li>Structured review criteria and chain-of-thought reasoning improve review quality by 25-50% (e.g., SpecGen F1 improvement from 0.76 to 0.95)</li>
                <li>Objective feedback mechanisms (executable tests, formal verification, compiler feedback) provide 15-35% stronger improvement signals than subjective LLM-based review alone</li>
                <li>Early stopping criteria (e.g., metric improvement >0.1, unchanged outputs for 2 rounds) prevent over-iteration while maintaining quality gains</li>
                <li>Review effectiveness is highest for tasks with objective correctness criteria and lowest for highly subjective creative tasks</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Multi-agent paper writing systems with 3-4 rounds of peer review will produce 20-30% higher-quality manuscripts (measured by human evaluation) than single-pass or 10+ round systems</li>
                <li>Vertical review structures will outperform democratic review for hypothesis refinement tasks by 15-25%, but democratic structures will outperform for literature review decomposition by 20-30%</li>
                <li>Adding explicit review criteria and chain-of-thought prompts to peer review will reduce erroneous critiques by 30-50% and improve final solution quality by 15-25%</li>
                <li>Combining LLM-based peer review with objective automated testing will improve code quality by 25-40% compared to LLM review alone</li>
                <li>Systems with 2-3 specialized reviewers will outperform systems with 5+ general reviewers by 15-25% on technical tasks while using 40-60% fewer tokens</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether learned review strategies (e.g., via RL on review effectiveness) can outperform human-designed review protocols by more than 20%</li>
                <li>The extent to which review quality depends on reviewer diversity vs. reviewer expertise (whether 3 diverse generalists outperform 3 specialized experts)</li>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal reviewer-to-solver ratio that maximizes quality while minimizing overhead across different task types</li>
                <li>How review effectiveness varies across different scientific domains (e.g., whether biology benefits more or less than computer science)</li>
                <li>Whether asynchronous review (reviewers see each other's comments) outperforms independent review (blind reviewing) in multi-agent systems</li>
                <li>The degree to which review benefits transfer across task domains (whether reviewers trained on code review can effectively review scientific hypotheses)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that single-pass generation with sufficient prompting and examples achieves equivalent quality to 3-5 rounds of review would challenge the necessity of iteration</li>
                <li>Finding that review rounds consistently introduce more errors than they fix (net negative contribution) would undermine the approach</li>
                <li>Showing that the time/cost overhead of multiple review rounds (2-5x token usage) outweighs quality benefits in production settings would limit practical applicability</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that reviewer agreement is no better than random chance would question the validity of peer review signals</li>
                <li>Finding that review effectiveness does not improve with stronger models (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5) would suggest fundamental limitations rather than capability issues</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Why some tasks (like creative writing in AGENTVERSE) benefit from review while others (like math reasoning with many reviewers) can be harmed by the same review structure <a href="../results/extraction-result-2563.html#e2563.0" class="evidence-link">[e2563.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2560.html#e2560.0" class="evidence-link">[e2560.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of reviewer incentives and motivation in multi-agent systems (unlike human peer review where reputation and career incentives exist) </li>
    <li>How to automatically determine the optimal number of review rounds for a given task without manual tuning or expensive search </li>
    <li>The interaction between review structure and task decomposition (whether vertical review works better with certain decomposition strategies) </li>
    <li>Why Agentless (simpler workflows) sometimes outperforms complex multi-agent review systems on maintenance benchmarks <a href="../results/extraction-result-2461.html#e2461.15" class="evidence-link">[e2461.15]</a> </li>
    <li>The extent to which review benefits depend on the base model capability (whether review helps GPT-3.5 more or less than GPT-4) </li>
    <li>How review effectiveness changes with task novelty (whether review helps more on familiar vs. novel problems) </li>
