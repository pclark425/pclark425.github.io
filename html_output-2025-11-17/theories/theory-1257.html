                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Abstraction Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that encodes graphs as a hierarchy of compositional abstractions, where local substructures (motifs, patterns) are mapped to reusable textual templates, and global structure is captured through explicit composition rules. This enables language models to generalize from seen subgraphs to novel graphs, and to efficiently learn graph reasoning by leveraging compositionality.</p>

                <li>There exists a finite set of motif templates sufficient to represent most real-world graphs for language model training.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical compositional representations may enable zero-shot generalization to entirely new graph domains.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If motif-based or hierarchical representations do not improve generalization or transfer, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If language models trained on compositional representations fail to reason about novel graphs, the theory would be weakened.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to select or learn the optimal set of motif templates for a given domain. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle graphs with highly irregular or non-compositional structure. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
