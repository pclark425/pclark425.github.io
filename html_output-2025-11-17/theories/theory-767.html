                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning via Chain-of-Thought and Program Synthesis in Large Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs perform arithmetic by implicitly synthesizing algorithmic procedures through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. When presented with arithmetic queries, LLMs generate intermediate reasoning steps that resemble program execution traces, effectively simulating algorithmic computation. The emergence of such reasoning is not explicitly programmed but arises from exposure to language data containing arithmetic patterns, instructions, and worked examples. The theory predicts that LLMs' arithmetic accuracy is enhanced by prompting strategies that elicit explicit stepwise reasoning, and that LLMs can generalize to novel arithmetic tasks by recombining learned reasoning patterns.</p>
