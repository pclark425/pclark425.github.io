                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs’ ability to perform first-order theory-of-mind (ToM) tasks is positively correlated with model size and training data diversity; however, the relationship is nuanced. While larger models trained on varied datasets generally exhibit superior ToM performance, the returns diminish as task complexity increases. Moreover, targeted fine-tuning, specialized training regimes, architectural modifications (such as multi-agent frameworks and modularized thought processes), and advanced prompting techniques can enable even smaller models (including those below 10B parameters) to achieve competitive ToM performance. This refined view recognizes that scale is a vital factor but is not the sole determinant of robust ToM reasoning.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing model size and training data diversity generally enhances first-order ToM performance.</li>
                <li>There are diminishing returns on increased scale, particularly for complex and dynamic ToM tasks.</li>
                <li>Targeted fine-tuning and specialized training regimes (e.g., adversarial data generation, instruction fine-tuning) can enable smaller models (<10B parameters) to achieve competitive ToM performance.</li>
                <li>Architectural optimizations, including modularized designs and multi-agent/metacognitive frameworks, as well as advanced prompting techniques, can substitute for pure scale in enhancing ToM reasoning.</li>
                <li>The relationship between model scale and ToM capability is moderated by task complexity and contextual factors, indicating that size alone is not a sufficient predictor of performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>CCoToM used a zero‐shot prompting method with GPT‐3.5‐Turbo (175B) to improve accuracy on BigToM, supporting that larger models trained on diverse data enhance ToM performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-139.html#e139.0" class="evidence-link">[e139.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Flan‐PaLM (540B) achieved near‐human performance on MoToMQA and showed that fine‐tuned large models benefit from diverse, instruction‐based data. <a href="../results/extraction-result-125.html#e125.1" class="evidence-link">[e125.1]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT‐3 (175B) demonstrated improved false‐belief task performance (55-60% accuracy) with diverse training data, supporting the positive correlation between model size and ToM task performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-140.html#e140.0" class="evidence-link">[e140.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT‐4 (175B) attained performance on false‐belief tasks comparable to that of 7-10-year-old children, reinforcing that larger models with varied training data achieve above-child-level ToM results. <a href="../results/extraction-result-116.html#e116.0" class="evidence-link">[e116.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Another GPT‐4 result (175B) recorded approximately 75% accuracy on false‐belief tasks, further evidencing the role of model scale and training data diversity in boosting ToM performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-130.html#e130.0" class="evidence-link">[e130.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Qwen2.5 experiments showed that larger versions (e.g., 7B models) achieved 94.5% accuracy on fourth-order ToM tasks, supporting a positive effect of scaling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-120.html#e120.0" class="evidence-link">[e120.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SPHINX-X results demonstrated that increasing parameters from 1.1B to 56B consistently boosts multi-modal understanding and reasoning, paralleling the benefits of scaling in ToM contexts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-135.html#e135.0" class="evidence-link">[e135.0]</a> </li>
    <li>o3-mini, built on GPT-3 architecture, showed over 90% accuracy on first-order ToM tasks, underscoring that with sufficient scale and diverse data, robust ToM performance is achievable. <a href="../results/extraction-result-133.html#e133.0" class="evidence-link">[e133.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Additional GPT-4 evidence via a Sally-Anne test demonstrated that with proper prompting, large models attain robust first-order ToM performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-140.html#e140.1" class="evidence-link">[e140.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing model size beyond current scales will yield positive but plateauing gains in standard first-order ToM tasks.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning on diverse and ToM-specific datasets will significantly improve performance across models, with smaller models showing marked improvements when optimized appropriately.</li>
                <li>Advanced prompting techniques, including chain-of-thought and meta-cognitive cues, will lead to enhanced ToM performance even in models not at the largest scale.</li>
                <li>Multilingual training data will improve ToM performance across languages, particularly for simpler ToM tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The exact model size threshold beyond which further increases yield negligible improvements in complex ToM tasks remains uncertain.</li>
                <li>The potential of multi-agent and metacognitive architectures to enhance higher-order ToM reasoning is yet to be fully determined.</li>
                <li>It is unclear whether fine-tuned small models can consistently outperform larger models across all ToM scenarios.</li>
                <li>The differential impact of training data quality versus quantity on various aspects of ToM reasoning is not fully understood.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a smaller model (<10B) does not show significant improvement after targeted fine-tuning on ToM-specific datasets, it would challenge the claim regarding the effectiveness of specialized training.</li>
                <li>If increasing model size beyond a certain threshold results in no further improvement or even a decline in performance on complex ToM tasks, it would question the assumption of a positive scale-performance relationship.</li>
                <li>If advanced prompting techniques fail to improve performance consistently across different models, the substitutability of architectural modifications for increased scale would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If models trained on diverse social narratives do not generalize better on applied ToM tasks, the role of training data diversity in enhancing ToM reasoning would be disputable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In the 'Pick the Right Stuff' task, smaller LLMs outperformed larger ones, directly challenging the notion that larger size always equates to better ToM performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-119.html#e119.0" class="evidence-link">[e119.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MeTHanol, an 8B model with modularized thought processing, achieved 98.2%-99.4% accuracy on ToM benchmarks, outperforming much larger models and suggesting that specialized fine-tuning can offset lower scale. <a href="../results/extraction-result-129.html#e129.0" class="evidence-link">[e129.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ToMAP, employing a 3B model augmented with specialized ToM modules, outperformed larger models in persuasion tasks by 39.4%, indicating that factors beyond model size can dominate performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-118.html#e118.0" class="evidence-link">[e118.0]</a> </li>
