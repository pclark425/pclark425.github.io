                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Instruction tuning and advanced prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought and step-by-step reasoning improve LLM performance on theory-of-mind tasks by providing explicit scaffolds that guide the model's reasoning process. These methods help models overcome limitations of implicit pattern recognition and enable better handling of complex or multi-step mental state inferences.</p>
