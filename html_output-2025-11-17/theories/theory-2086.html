                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs can be used to iteratively generate, test, and refine candidate quantitative laws by programmatically extracting relationships from scholarly texts, proposing hypotheses, and validating them against extracted or external data, thus emulating the scientific method at scale.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover novel, previously unreported laws by synthesizing weak signals across many papers.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to validate candidate equations against data, the resulting laws will be unreliable.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot refine hypotheses based on validation, the process will stagnate and fail to improve.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the challenge of data availability or quality for validation. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how LLMs handle conflicting validation results from different datasets. </li>
