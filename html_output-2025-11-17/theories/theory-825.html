                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Driven Memory Routing Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can maximize task success by dynamically routing memory queries based on explicit task structure and subgoal decomposition. The agent identifies subgoals, maps them to relevant memory types (episodic, semantic, external), and routes queries accordingly, enabling efficient and context-sensitive memory use.</p>
