                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Calibration-Dependent LLM Probability Estimation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLMs can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The ability of LLMs to accurately measure the probability of future real-world scientific discoveries is fundamentally limited by the calibration of their internal uncertainty estimates, which are affected by model architecture, training regime (especially RLHF/alignment), and the method of probability extraction (logit-based, verbalized, or ensemble-based). Proper calibration methods and careful extraction of uncertainty are necessary for trustworthy probabilistic forecasting.</p>
