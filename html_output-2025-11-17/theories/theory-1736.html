                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Generalized Language Model Representation and Adaptation Theory for Anomaly Detection in Lists and Tabular Data</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs construct generalized internal representations of list and tabular data, enabling them to adaptively detect anomalies by comparing new items to these learned representations. The theory emphasizes the LLM's ability to abstract both local (row-wise) and global (dataset-level) patterns, and to adapt its anomaly detection criteria based on the context and structure of the data.</p>
