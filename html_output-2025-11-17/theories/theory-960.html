                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Coordination Principle for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents in text games achieve superior performance by organizing memory access and update processes hierarchically, with higher-level controllers managing the flow of information between memory modules and the agent's reasoning core. This hierarchical coordination enables the agent to plan, abstract, and generalize across episodes, while maintaining efficient access to both recent and long-term information.</p>
