                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Multi-Modal, Multi-Stage Evaluation for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-modal (combining quantitative metrics, qualitative expert review, and empirical validation) and multi-stage (screening, deep review, and post-hoc analysis) process. Each stage and modality addresses distinct failure modes and biases, and their integration provides a more holistic and robust assessment than any single approach.</p>
