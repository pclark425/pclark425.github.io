                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-214</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive Experience Memory Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents can use memory to help solve text games.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that agents can significantly improve their performance in text games by maintaining a memory system that specifically stores, retrieves, and leverages positive experiences (successful action sequences, rewarding states, and goal-achieving trajectories). Unlike general experience replay that stores all experiences, this theory emphasizes selective storage of positive outcomes, which provides multiple benefits: (1) efficient learning by focusing on what works rather than what fails, (2) guided exploration by biasing action selection toward previously successful patterns, (3) faster convergence by avoiding re-exploration of known dead ends, and (4) transfer learning by recognizing similar situations where past successes can be applied. The theory posits that positive experiences serve as a form of procedural memory that encodes 'how to succeed' rather than 'what to avoid', making them particularly valuable for goal-directed behavior in sparse reward environments typical of text games.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents that selectively store positive experiences (high-reward trajectories, goal-achieving sequences) will learn more efficiently than agents that store all experiences uniformly, particularly in sparse reward environments.</li>
                <li>The value of positive experience memory increases with the sparsity of rewards in the environment - the rarer successful experiences are, the more important it is to remember and leverage them.</li>
                <li>Positive experiences should be retrieved and utilized when the agent encounters situations similar to those in which the positive experience occurred, providing a form of analogical transfer.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of positive experience memory depends on three key components: (1) accurate identification of what constitutes a 'positive' experience, (2) efficient retrieval mechanisms that match current situations to stored experiences, and (3) appropriate adaptation mechanisms that apply stored experiences to novel but similar situations.</li>
                <li>Positive experience memory provides the greatest benefit during early learning phases and in novel situations, while its benefit diminishes as the agent develops robust policies through extensive training.</li>
                <li>Agents with positive experience memory will show asymmetric learning curves - rapid improvement when positive experiences are discovered and stored, followed by plateaus until new positive experiences are found.</li>
                <li>The storage capacity and retention policy for positive experiences critically affects performance - storing too few experiences limits transfer, while storing too many without prioritization dilutes the signal.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Text games typically have sparse reward structures where successful action sequences are rare, making positive experiences particularly valuable to identify and remember. </li>
    <li>Reinforcement learning agents benefit from experience replay mechanisms that allow them to learn from past experiences multiple times. </li>
    <li>Prioritized experience replay, which emphasizes high-reward or surprising experiences, improves learning efficiency over uniform sampling. </li>
    <li>Human learning and memory systems show preferential encoding and retention of positive outcomes and successful strategies. </li>
    <li>Case-based reasoning systems successfully solve problems by retrieving and adapting solutions from past successful cases. </li>
    <li>Imitation learning and learning from demonstrations show that agents can learn effectively from observing successful behavior. </li>
    <li>Episodic memory systems in AI agents can store and retrieve specific past experiences to guide future behavior. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An agent with positive experience memory will require fewer environment interactions to achieve the same performance level as an agent without such memory in text games with sparse rewards.</li>
                <li>When transferred to a new but related text game, agents with positive experience memory from the source game will show faster initial learning than agents starting from scratch.</li>
                <li>Agents will show improved performance on text game puzzles that have structural similarities to previously solved puzzles, even when surface features differ.</li>
                <li>The frequency of retrieving and utilizing stored positive experiences will be highest during early exploration and will decrease as the agent develops a stable policy.</li>
                <li>Agents with positive experience memory will show reduced variance in performance across different random seeds compared to agents without such memory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether positive experience memory can enable zero-shot or few-shot transfer to entirely new text game genres (e.g., from fantasy adventure to science fiction mystery) is unknown but would demonstrate powerful abstraction capabilities if successful.</li>
                <li>The optimal ratio of positive to negative experiences to store for maximum learning efficiency is unknown and may vary by game type, but finding this ratio could significantly improve sample efficiency.</li>
                <li>Whether positive experience memory can help agents discover and avoid deceptive reward signals (local optima that appear positive but prevent reaching global optima) is uncertain but critical for robust behavior.</li>
                <li>The extent to which positive experience memory can compensate for poor exploration strategies is unknown - it may enable agents with simple exploration to match or exceed agents with sophisticated exploration but no memory.</li>
                <li>Whether agents can learn to identify 'meta-positive' experiences (strategies for finding positive experiences) and whether storing these provides compounding benefits is unknown but could lead to exponential learning improvements.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with positive experience memory perform no better than agents with random experience sampling in dense reward environments, it would suggest the benefit is specific to sparse reward settings.</li>
                <li>If the computational cost of storing, retrieving, and matching positive experiences exceeds the benefit from reduced environment interactions, it would limit practical applicability.</li>
                <li>If positive experience memory leads to premature convergence on suboptimal strategies (by over-exploiting early successes), it would reveal a critical failure mode requiring mitigation.</li>
                <li>If agents cannot effectively retrieve relevant positive experiences when needed (due to poor similarity matching or retrieval failures), the memory system provides no benefit despite storage overhead.</li>
                <li>If positive experiences from one text game consistently fail to transfer to other games (even similar ones), it would challenge the generalization claims of the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the exact threshold or criteria for determining what constitutes a 'positive' experience worthy of storage (e.g., absolute reward threshold, relative ranking, novelty-adjusted value). </li>
    <li>How to handle situations where initially positive experiences later prove suboptimal as the agent discovers better strategies is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify the optimal memory capacity or forgetting mechanisms for managing limited storage resources. </li>
    <li>How to balance exploitation of stored positive experiences with exploration for potentially better new experiences is not fully specified. </li>
    <li>The interaction between positive experience memory and other learning mechanisms (e.g., policy gradients, value function approximation) is not detailed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
