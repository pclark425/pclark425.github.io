                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can iteratively refine quantitative feature–property laws by integrating new literature, experimental data, and user feedback, leading to a dynamic, self-improving system for molecular science discovery. The LLM acts as a continual learner, updating its internal representations and synthesized rules as new evidence accumulates, thereby improving the accuracy and generalizability of its predictions over time.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>If LLMs fail to revise or discard outdated or contradicted laws, the dynamic refinement claim would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If user feedback does not result in measurable changes in LLM-generated laws, the feedback integration aspect would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The potential for catastrophic forgetting or bias accumulation in LLMs during continual learning is not fully addressed. </li>
