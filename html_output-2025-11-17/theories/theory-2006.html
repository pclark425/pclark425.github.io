                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Human Collaboration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most robust qualitative laws are distilled from scholarly corpora when LLMs and human experts engage in iterative cycles of law proposal, critique, and refinement. LLMs generate candidate laws from the corpus, which are then evaluated, critiqued, and refined by human experts, with the process repeating until consensus and explanatory adequacy are achieved. This collaborative process leverages the pattern recognition and abstraction abilities of LLMs and the domain expertise and critical reasoning of humans.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Expert feedback will reduce ambiguity and increase the contextual validity of LLM-distilled laws.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The collaborative process may enable the discovery of novel laws that neither LLMs nor humans would have identified independently.</li>
                <li>Repeated cycles of critique may reveal systematic blind spots in both LLM and human reasoning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative LLM-human collaboration does not improve the quality of distilled laws, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If expert feedback fails to resolve ambiguities or errors in LLM outputs, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The potential for human bias to be introduced or amplified during the refinement process is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The scalability of the collaborative process for very large corpora is not considered. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory adapts established collaborative refinement to a new context of LLM-driven law distillation.</p>
