                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compartmental Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia while others remain resistant, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Within individual neurons, different subcellular compartments (soma, dendrites, axons, synapses) show distinct patterns of vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology based on local molecular machinery, cytoskeletal organization, and exposure to pathological proteins. Dendritic compartments, particularly apical dendrites, are more vulnerable to spine loss and structural damage from local amyloid plaques, while somatic compartments can remain structurally preserved even when in direct contact with plaques. Axonal compartments show complex patterns with proximal segments accumulating tau while distal segments may show depletion. Synaptic compartments are early sites of tau seeding and show enrichment of seed-competent phosphorylated tau before overt pathology develops. This compartment-specific vulnerability explains why neurons can show partial dysfunction and selective loss of specific processes while maintaining overall viability.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Measuring tau levels in isolated synaptic, somatic, and axonal fractions from the same neurons should reveal temporal progression with synaptic accumulation preceding somatic accumulation.</li>
                <li>Protecting dendritic spines specifically (e.g., with actin-stabilizing agents) should reduce functional deficits even without preventing somatic tau accumulation.</li>
                <li>Neurons with longer apical dendrites should show greater vulnerability to spine loss than neurons with shorter apical dendrites in the same cortical region.</li>
                <li>Blocking tau entry specifically into synaptic compartments should delay the onset of overt tangle pathology in neuronal somata.</li>
                <li>Measuring cofilin phosphorylation status in apical versus basal dendrites should reveal compartment-specific differences that predict vulnerability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Would artificially redistributing tau from synaptic to somatic compartments reduce functional deficits, or would this accelerate cell death?</li>
                <li>If dendritic spines could be continuously regenerated at the same rate as they are lost, would neurons maintain function indefinitely despite ongoing pathology?</li>
                <li>Could selectively enhancing proteostasis machinery in dendritic compartments prevent spine loss without affecting somatic tau accumulation?</li>
                <li>Would preventing the physical contact between plaques and neuronal membranes (e.g., through glial barriers) be sufficient to preserve perisomatic synapses?</li>
                <li>If axonal tau could be prevented from redistributing to somatodendritic compartments, would this prevent all downstream pathology or only delay it?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that somatic compartments are equally or more vulnerable than dendritic compartments to amyloid toxicity would contradict the dendritic vulnerability law.</li>
                <li>Discovering that synaptic tau accumulation occurs after somatic accumulation would challenge the synaptic seeding priority law.</li>
                <li>Observing that apical and basal dendrites show identical vulnerability patterns would contradict the differential vulnerability law.</li>
                <li>Finding that neurons in contact with plaques maintain normal perisomatic synaptic density would challenge the synapse exclusion law.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that proximal and distal axonal compartments show identical tau levels would contradict the redistribution law.</li>
