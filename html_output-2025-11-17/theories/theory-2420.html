                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Activity and Metabolic Load Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their patterns of network activity and associated metabolic demands. Neurons with high synaptic activity, elevated calcium influx, and greater oxidative metabolism are more susceptible to Aβ/tau-induced stress, while those with lower activity or more efficient energy management are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing network activity in resistant neurons will render them vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological reduction of calcium influx in vulnerable neurons will prevent pathology even under high activity.</li>
                <li>Boosting metabolic efficiency in already resistant neurons will further increase resistance or have no effect.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If high activity neurons do not show increased vulnerability to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If enhancing mitochondrial efficiency does not confer resistance, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If reducing calcium influx does not protect high-activity neurons, the theory would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some low-activity neurons still accumulate pathology, suggesting other factors are involved. </li>
    <li>Certain high-activity neurons remain resistant, possibly due to unknown protective mechanisms. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
