                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is represented along a continuum from modal (sensory-motor grounded) to amodal (abstract, symbolic) formats, with dynamic hybridization mechanisms allowing flexible integration and transformation between these formats depending on context, task demands, and learning history. Rather than being strictly segregated, modal and amodal representations are functionally interconvertible, and the brain can dynamically recruit, blend, or transform these representations to optimize conceptual processing.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows both sensory-motor and abstract regions are activated during conceptual tasks, with graded patterns depending on task and concept type. </li>
    <li>Behavioral priming and interference effects suggest both perceptual and abstract codes are accessible for the same concept. </li>
    <li>Multivariate pattern analysis reveals that conceptual similarity is reflected in both sensory-motor and higher-order association cortices, with representational similarity varying by concept type. </li>
    <li>Lesion studies show that damage to either modal or amodal regions can selectively impair different aspects of conceptual processing, but rarely abolish conceptual knowledge entirely. </li>
    <li>Developmental studies indicate that children initially rely more on modal representations, with increasing abstraction (amodalization) as they age and acquire expertise. </li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If all conceptual tasks always activate only modal or only amodal regions, regardless of context or task demands, the continuum and hybridization claims would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If patients with damage to both modal and amodal regions cannot compensate by recruiting alternative representational formats, the dynamic hybridization mechanism would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If representational similarity analysis fails to reveal any graded or blended patterns between modal and amodal codes, the continuum hypothesis would be undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise neural mechanisms underlying the transformation between modal and amodal codes are not specified at the functional level. </li>
