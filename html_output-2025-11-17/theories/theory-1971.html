                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Universal Qualitative Law Distillers</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, by virtue of their exposure to vast and heterogeneous scientific literature, act as universal distillers of qualitative laws. They identify, abstract, and re-express the underlying qualitative regularities that govern phenomena across fields, even when those regularities are expressed in different terminologies or conceptual frameworks. The process is not limited to explicit law extraction, but includes the generation of new, higher-order qualitative laws that are not present in any single input source.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>An LLM will identify and restate a qualitative law about feedback loops that applies to both biological and economic systems, despite different terminologies.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may generate a new qualitative law that unifies principles from neuroscience and materials science.</li>
                <li>A sufficiently advanced LLM may propose a law that predicts emergent behavior in a field with little prior formalization.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs cannot abstract common laws from differently-termed input, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If the laws produced are superficial or fail to capture the underlying regularities, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of ambiguous or conflicting terminology on law abstraction is not fully addressed. </li>
