                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Emergent Cross-Domain Law Synthesizers</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large, diverse corpora of scholarly literature, can synthesize qualitative laws that transcend disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging their emergent abilities in abstraction, analogical reasoning, and context-sensitive mapping, LLMs can identify, reconcile, and articulate underlying regularities that are expressed in disparate terminologies and frameworks, effectively functioning as engines for the discovery of cross-domain scientific laws.</p>
