                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory of Neuronal Resistance</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the resistance of certain neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular programs, specifically the cohesiveness and robustness of neuroprotective pathways such as canonical Wnt signaling, metabolic stability, and reduced transcriptional reprogramming. Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) exhibit greater stability of gene expression, fewer 'switch genes', and more cohesive neuroprotective networks compared to vulnerable populations (e.g., in hippocampus or association cortex). This intrinsic molecular resilience confers protection against both amyloid-β and tau-induced degeneration, resulting in delayed or reduced pathology and neurodegeneration.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is a novel synthesis of molecular and network evidence, though related to known neuroprotective pathways.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Wnt signaling and metabolic stability are known to be neuroprotective, but not formalized as determinants of regional resistance in AD.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the link between pathway cohesiveness and resistance in V1 neurons, integrating transcriptomic and network data.</p>
