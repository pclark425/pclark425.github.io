                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Hypothesis Refinement in LLM-Driven Law Extraction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when tasked with extracting quantitative laws from large scholarly corpora, operate through an iterative process of hypothesis generation, testing, and refinement. The LLM first proposes candidate quantitative relationships based on aggregated evidence, then evaluates these candidates against further textual and tabular data, refining or discarding hypotheses based on consistency, coverage, and predictive power. This process mimics aspects of the scientific method, but is driven by the LLM's internal pattern recognition and reasoning capabilities.</p>
