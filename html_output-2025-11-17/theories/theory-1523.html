                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1523</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal FTL via Nonlocal Quantum Information Channels and Macroscopic Entanglement</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL travel can be achieved by exploiting nonlocal quantum information channels, specifically by creating and maintaining macroscopic entanglement between distant points in spacetime. By engineering large-scale entangled states and using quantum teleportation protocols, a spacecraft's information and structure can be instantaneously reconstructed at a distant location, effectively achieving FTL relocation without violating causality or requiring infinite energy. The theory suggests that advances in quantum error correction, entanglement distribution, and matter reassembly technologies could make this approach feasible within realistic budgets.</p>
