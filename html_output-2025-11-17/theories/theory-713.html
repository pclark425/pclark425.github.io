                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models, when sufficiently large and trained on diverse data, can develop emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities that allow them to approximate symbolic arithmetic operations. These capabilities arise not from explicit programming, but from the model's internalization of algorithmic patterns through exposure to data, enabling it to perform multi-step computations in a distributed, parallel fashion.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is scaled up and trained on more diverse arithmetic data, its arithmetic performance will improve and show more algorithmic generalization.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on arithmetic in a novel numeral system, emergent algorithmic reasoning may or may not develop depending on data diversity and scale.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained with explicit feedback on intermediate computation steps, distributed algorithmic circuits may become more interpretable.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If large models with diverse data do not develop improved arithmetic abilities, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If distributed computation is not observed in model activations during arithmetic, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some small models can perform simple arithmetic, suggesting that emergent algorithmic reasoning is not strictly necessary for all cases. </li>
