                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Latent Circuit Augmentation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that arithmetic fine-tuning in language models leads to the hierarchical organization of latent circuits, where lower-level circuits encode digit-wise operations (e.g., addition, carry), and higher-level circuits coordinate these subroutines to implement multi-step algorithms. The hierarchical augmentation of these circuits enables compositional generalization and transfer to more complex arithmetic tasks.</p>
