                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Augmented Inductive Synthesis of Quantitative Scientific Laws</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large corpora of scholarly papers, can perform inductive synthesis to extract, generalize, and formalize quantitative laws by aggregating, abstracting, and reconciling diverse empirical findings. The LLM leverages its ability to parse natural language, recognize mathematical expressions, and identify patterns across studies to propose candidate laws that unify disparate results, even in the presence of noise or incomplete reporting.</p>
