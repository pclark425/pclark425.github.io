                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Architectures Enable Robust Long-Horizon Reasoning and Generalization in LLM Agents for Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents equipped with hybrid memory architectures—combining both episodic (short-term, context-specific) and semantic (long-term, abstracted) memory—can achieve robust long-horizon reasoning and generalization in text-based game environments. The hybrid approach allows agents to flexibly retrieve detailed context when needed, while also leveraging abstracted knowledge for transfer and planning, thus overcoming the limitations of purely context-window-based or static memory systems.</p>
