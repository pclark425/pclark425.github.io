                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents in text games achieve optimal task performance by integrating hierarchical episodic and semantic memory systems. Episodic memory encodes temporally ordered, context-rich experiences, while semantic memory encodes abstracted, generalized knowledge about the game world. The agent dynamically selects between these memory types based on the current task phase, uncertainty, and novelty, enabling both flexible adaptation to new situations and efficient exploitation of learned regularities.</p>
