                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1651</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Interactive Feedback Loop Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as simulators in scientific subdomains is dynamically shaped by the presence and quality of interactive feedback during simulation. Subdomains that allow for iterative querying, clarification, and correction (e.g., through user prompts or tool integration) enable LLMs to self-correct and refine outputs, leading to higher simulation accuracy, while static, one-shot simulations are more prone to persistent errors.</p>
