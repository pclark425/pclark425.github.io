                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Optimization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-optimization, where each cycle of generate-then-reflect enables the model to identify, evaluate, and correct errors or suboptimal reasoning in its previous outputs. The process leverages the model's internal representations and prior outputs to refine its answers, leading to cumulative improvements over multiple iterations.</p>
