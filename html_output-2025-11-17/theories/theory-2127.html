                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Modular Orchestration Theory (HMOT) of Adaptive LLM-Symbolic Integration for Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective LLM-driven scientific theory distillation arises from hybrid modular orchestration that dynamically integrates LLM modules with symbolic reasoning and algorithmic components. The orchestration mechanism adaptively routes sub-tasks (e.g., formal logic, citation network analysis, mathematical abstraction) to either LLMs or symbolic/algorithmic modules based on task requirements and feedback, enabling both deep language understanding and rigorous formal reasoning. This adaptive hybridization is posited to yield more robust, interpretable, and generalizable scientific theories from large scholarly corpora.</p>
