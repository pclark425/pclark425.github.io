                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that in the context of LLM-generated scientific hypothesis generation, there exists an inherent tradeoff between maximizing novelty (the degree to which a hypothesis is not present in the literature) and maximizing validity (the degree to which a hypothesis reflects reality or is judged correct by experts or LLM-based evaluators). Feedback mechanisms—such as present-feedback, future-feedback, and past-feedback—can be tuned to shift the balance between these two dimensions. Optimizing for one dimension (e.g., novelty) will, beyond a certain point, reduce the other (e.g., validity), and the optimal balance depends on the intended use-case (e.g., exploratory vs. confirmatory science). The theory further asserts that this tradeoff is observable and quantifiable in LLM-based scientific hypothesis generation pipelines, and that feedback modules can be systematically adjusted to control the novelty-validity profile of outputs.</p>

<ol>
    <li>TOMATO and BHP studies report that higher novelty scores are often associated with lower validity scores, and that feedback mechanisms can shift this balance. The TOMATO paper explicitly notes a trade-off between novelty and validness, and that increasing novelty via feedback mechanisms can reduce validness. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.2" class="evidence-link">[e3819.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3814.html#e3814.2" class="evidence-link">[e3814.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.4" class="evidence-link">[e3819.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Ablation studies in TOMATO show that future-feedback and past-feedback increase novelty and helpfulness, while present-feedback increases validity, and that increasing novelty can come at the expense of validness. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.4" class="evidence-link">[e3819.4]</a> </li>
    <li>The TOMATO evaluation metrics and expert evaluation (Likert scores) show that methods that increase novelty (e.g., future-feedback, multi-agent debate) can reduce validness, and vice versa. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.2" class="evidence-link">[e3819.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.4" class="evidence-link">[e3819.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.1" class="evidence-link">[e3819.1]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the weight of the novelty checker is increased in the feedback loop, the average novelty score of generated hypotheses will increase, but the average validity score will decrease, as measured by expert or LLM-based evaluation.</li>
                <li>If the reality checker is emphasized in the feedback loop, the average validity score will increase, but the average novelty score will decrease.</li>
                <li>If present-feedback iterations are increased beyond 3, validness and novelty will plateau or decrease, and helpfulness will decrease.</li>
                <li>If multi-agent debate is used, the generated hypotheses will be rated as more novel and helpful than single-agent baselines, but not necessarily more valid.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a multi-objective optimization is used to balance novelty and validity (e.g., via Pareto frontier search), there exists an optimal point that maximizes both for a given domain, and this point will differ by scientific field.</li>
                <li>If feedback modules are dynamically tuned based on user intent (e.g., exploratory vs. confirmatory), the system can adaptively generate hypotheses with the desired novelty-validity profile, and user satisfaction will increase.</li>
                <li>If the LLM is fine-tuned on high-novelty, high-validity examples, the tradeoff curve will shift, allowing higher joint scores than in the base model.</li>
                <li>If the domain is one with sparse prior literature, maximizing novelty may not reduce validity as much, and the tradeoff curve will be less steep.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If increasing the novelty feedback does not decrease validity, or vice versa, the tradeoff law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If feedback tuning fails to shift the balance between novelty and validity (i.e., the output profile is invariant to feedback module weights), the feedback mechanism tuning law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If present-feedback iterations can be increased indefinitely with monotonic improvement in all metrics, the Feedback Iteration Law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If multi-agent debate does not increase novelty or helpfulness compared to single-agent baselines, the Multi-Agent Debate Law is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to measure or optimize for other dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, clarity, verifiability, or user satisfaction) in the presence of the novelty-validity tradeoff, though these are reported as important in TOMATO and BHP. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.2" class="evidence-link">[e3819.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.4" class="evidence-link">[e3819.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3814.html#e3814.2" class="evidence-link">[e3814.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for the impact of LLM scale, pretraining data, or fine-tuning on the shape or steepness of the tradeoff curve. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3814.html#e3814.2" class="evidence-link">[e3814.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.2" class="evidence-link">[e3819.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain the effect of domain-specific factors (e.g., biomedical vs. social science) on the tradeoff, though evidence suggests domain matters. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3814.html#e3814.0" class="evidence-link">[e3814.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.2" class="evidence-link">[e3819.2]</a> </li>
