                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metric Engineering via Quantum Vacuum Manipulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by manipulating the quantum vacuum using high-intensity electromagnetic fields and Casimir-like configurations, it is possible to locally engineer spacetime metrics, creating effective FTL corridors for spacecraft. The approach leverages the ability of strong fields and boundary conditions to alter vacuum energy density, thus modifying the local speed of light and spacetime curvature within engineered regions, all within the reach of current or near-future technology and budgets.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Scaling up Casimir-like effects to macroscopic corridors will allow a small probe to traverse 1 AU in less than 8 minutes, as measured externally.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If no measurable change in light speed or metric is observed in engineered vacuum regions, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If attempts to create such corridors result in unmanageable energy requirements or destructive side effects, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
