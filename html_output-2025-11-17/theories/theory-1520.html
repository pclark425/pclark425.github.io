                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Functional Partitioning via Stable Coactivation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the brain functionally partitions conceptual space by dynamically forming and maintaining stable coactivation patterns among distributed representational units. These partitions are not fixed anatomical regions, but functional assemblies that can overlap, merge, or split depending on task demands and learning. The individuation of concepts is thus a dynamic process, governed by the stability and reproducibility of coactivation patterns, rather than by static localization.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Functional assemblies for concepts will dynamically reconfigure depending on task demands, but maintain core stable coactivation patterns.</li>
                <li>Overlap between assemblies will predict conceptual similarity and generalization patterns.</li>
                <li>Disruption of dynamic assembly formation (e.g., via pharmacological intervention) will impair flexible concept access.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In highly novel or creative tasks, new functional assemblies may emerge that do not correspond to any pre-existing concept.</li>
                <li>Artificial systems implementing dynamic functional partitioning may develop novel forms of conceptual blending or abstraction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If functional assemblies do not dynamically reconfigure with task demands, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If stable coactivation patterns do not predict concept discrimination, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the mechanisms by which assemblies are formed or dissolved at the neural level. </li>
    <li>It does not address the role of long-term consolidation in stabilizing functional assemblies. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
