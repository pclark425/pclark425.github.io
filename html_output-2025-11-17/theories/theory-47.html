                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Complementarity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents can use memory to help solve text games, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Optimal performance in text-based games requires hybrid memory systems that combine semantic memory (structured knowledge graphs capturing entity-relation facts) with episodic memory (raw observational records) because different task components require different memory modalities: navigation and spatial reasoning benefit from semantic graphs, while procedural recall and instruction-following require episodic detail. The synergy between these memory types exceeds the sum of their individual contributions.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Task performance is maximized when memory modality matches task requirements: semantic graphs for spatial/relational reasoning, episodic records for procedural/sequential reasoning.</li>
                <li>The performance gain from hybrid memory is super-additive: hybrid memory performance > semantic-only performance + episodic-only performance - baseline, due to synergistic retrieval where episodic edges link to relevant semantic facts.</li>
                <li>For navigation-dominant tasks, semantic memory contributes 80-90% of performance; for procedural-dominant tasks, episodic memory contributes 50-70% of performance beyond semantic baseline.</li>
                <li>Episodic memory becomes increasingly critical as task complexity increases: the performance gap between hybrid and semantic-only memory grows with the number of procedural steps required.</li>
                <li>Hybrid memory systems require explicit linking mechanisms (e.g., hyperedges connecting co-occurring facts) to achieve synergy; independent semantic and episodic stores without links provide minimal advantage over single-modality memory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>AriGraph with full semantic+episodic memory achieves perfect scores (1.0) on Cooking tasks, while semantic-only variant drops to 0.64 (Medium) and 0.45 (Hard) <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.0" class="evidence-link">[e238.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.1" class="evidence-link">[e238.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Episodic memory component substantially improves performance on tasks requiring detailed observation recall (Cooking), while semantic graph alone supports navigation <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.1" class="evidence-link">[e238.1]</a> </li>
    <li>AriGraph without episodic memory shows high performance on navigation-heavy Cleaning (0.92) but degraded performance on procedural Cooking tasks <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.1" class="evidence-link">[e238.1]</a> </li>
    <li>AriGraph's hybrid memory enables near-oracle NetHack performance (593 score) with restricted observations, approaching full-observation baseline (675) <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.0" class="evidence-link">[e238.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.8" class="evidence-link">[e238.8]</a> </li>
    <li>Semantic memory alone is sufficient for navigation-heavy tasks but lacks detailed step recall needed for procedural tasks <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.1" class="evidence-link">[e238.1]</a> </li>
    <li>RAG baseline (vector retrieval only) underperforms AriGraph across all tasks, showing unstructured retrieval is insufficient <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.5" class="evidence-link">[e238.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Summarization baseline loses fine-grained episodic detail, performing worse than hybrid memory on procedural tasks <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.4" class="evidence-link">[e238.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a new text game requiring both navigation through a 20+ room environment AND following a 10-step recipe, hybrid memory will show >40% improvement over semantic-only and >30% improvement over episodic-only approaches.</li>
                <li>For tasks with interleaved navigation and procedural steps (e.g., 'go to kitchen, chop vegetables, go to pantry, get spices, return to kitchen, cook'), hybrid memory will show >50% improvement over either single-modality approach.</li>
                <li>In games where procedural instructions are given once at the beginning and must be recalled later, episodic memory will be essential: semantic-only approaches will achieve <30% success rate while hybrid approaches will achieve >80%.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In text games requiring counterfactual reasoning ('what would have happened if I had taken the other path?'), it's unclear whether episodic memory of alternative branches or semantic abstraction of causal rules would be more beneficial - performance difference could range from -20% to +40%.</li>
                <li>For games with unreliable narrators or contradictory information, maintaining both semantic (integrated beliefs) and episodic (raw contradictory observations) memory might enable better reasoning, but could also cause confusion - net effect unknown.</li>
                <li>In highly procedural tasks where the same procedure must be executed many times with slight variations, it's unclear whether episodic memory of each execution helps (providing examples) or hurts (causing interference) - could show anywhere from -15% to +25% impact.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding tasks where semantic-only memory consistently outperforms hybrid memory would challenge the complementarity claim.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that episodic and semantic memory provide exactly additive benefits (no synergy) would challenge the super-additive interaction claim.</li>
                <li>Showing that in purely procedural tasks with no navigation, semantic memory provides no benefit over episodic-only would challenge the universal value of semantic structure.</li>
                <li>Finding that unlinking episodic and semantic memory (storing them independently) provides the same performance as linked hybrid memory would challenge the importance of explicit connection mechanisms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The optimal ratio of semantic to episodic memory capacity for different task types is not characterized <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.0" class="evidence-link">[e238.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.1" class="evidence-link">[e238.1]</a> </li>
    <li>How to handle conflicts between semantic beliefs and episodic observations is not fully addressed <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.0" class="evidence-link">[e238.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The computational cost tradeoffs between maintaining both memory types versus single-modality memory are not quantified <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.0" class="evidence-link">[e238.0]</a> </li>
