                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Task Decomposition Enables Effective LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) achieve effective self-reflection and iterative answer improvement by decomposing complex tasks into hierarchical subtasks, enabling targeted reflection and correction at multiple levels of abstraction. The process supervision mechanism leverages this decomposition, allowing the model to focus reflection on specific reasoning steps or subcomponents, thereby amplifying the efficiency and reliability of self-correction across iterations.</p>
