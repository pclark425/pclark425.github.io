                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Symbolic Reasoning through Distributed Representations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs develop emergent symbolic reasoning capabilities for spatial puzzles by encoding spatial and logical relationships in distributed vector representations. Through training on large corpora, the model internalizes abstract rules and spatial patterns, enabling it to simulate symbolic manipulation (such as elimination and deduction) in a sub-symbolic, parallel fashion, even without explicit symbolic modules.</p>
