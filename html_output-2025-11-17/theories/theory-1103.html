                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory: Information Loss Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory asserts that the neuro-symbolic interface bottleneck in language models leads to information loss during logical reasoning. As neural models process information in high-dimensional, distributed representations, the mapping to and from explicit symbolic states is lossy, resulting in degraded logical fidelity, especially in tasks requiring precise state tracking and manipulation.</p>

    <li>Empirical studies show LLMs make more errors as logical chains grow longer, suggesting information is lost. </li>
