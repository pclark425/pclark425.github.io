                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cognitive Plausibility and Transferability Principle for Graph-to-Text Representations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that ideal graph-to-text representations are those that not only align structurally and semantically with both the source graph and the target text, but also reflect cognitive strategies used by humans in mapping structured data to language. Such representations are hypothesized to facilitate transfer learning across domains and tasks, as they encode information in a way that is both interpretable and adaptable.</p>
