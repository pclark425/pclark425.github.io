                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured and Interpretable Memory Representations Enable Efficient Planning, Exploration, and Error Recovery in LLM Agents for Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents equipped with structured and interpretable memory representations—wherein game state, actions, goals, and environment knowledge are organized in explicit, human-interpretable formats—achieve superior planning, exploration, and error recovery in text-based game environments. Such memory structures allow agents to reason about their past actions, current state, and future possibilities, leading to more sample-efficient learning, robust error correction, and the ability to generalize strategies across tasks.</p>
