                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Threshold Theory: Scaling-Structure Interaction Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the emergence of strict logical reasoning in language models is governed by an interaction between model scale (parameters, depth, and width) and the presence of explicit logical structure in the training data. There exists a critical region in the space defined by model scale and logical structure density, such that only when both exceed their respective thresholds does strict logical reasoning reliably emerge.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Large models trained on code/math/formal logic data outperform smaller models and those trained on generic text in logical reasoning tasks. </li>
    <li>Scaling up models trained on low-density data does not yield strict logical reasoning. </li>
    <li>Small models trained on high-density logical data also fail to achieve strict logical reasoning. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show sharp transitions in reasoning ability at certain model sizes and data types (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM, Llama-2). </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior work formalizes a two-dimensional threshold (scale and structure) for strict logical reasoning emergence.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Scaling laws and data quality effects are known, but not their explicit interaction for logical reasoning emergence.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit critical region in the scale-structure space for reasoning emergence is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Models below either the scale or structure threshold will not exhibit strict logical reasoning, even if the other is high.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The critical region may shift depending on the logical system (e.g., propositional vs. higher-order logic).</li>
                <li>Hybrid architectures (e.g., LLMs with symbolic modules) may alter or bypass the critical region.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a small model with high logical structure density data achieves strict logical reasoning, the law is challenged.</li>

<ol>
    <li>Some models may learn shallow heuristics that mimic logical reasoning without true generalization. </li>
