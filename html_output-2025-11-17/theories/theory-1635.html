                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1635</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory of LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the simulation accuracy of LLMs in scientific subdomains is fundamentally constrained by an information bottleneck: the effective capacity of the LLM to compress, abstract, and retrieve relevant domain knowledge from its training data. The narrower the bottleneck (due to model size, training data limitations, or representational inefficiency), the more likely the LLM is to omit critical subdomain-specific information, leading to reduced simulation accuracy.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
