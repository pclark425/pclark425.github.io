                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Multi-Agent Evaluation Theory for LLM-Generated Science</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories arises from a dynamic, multi-agent system in which multiple LLMs and human experts iteratively critique, defend, and refine candidate theories. The process is modeled as a structured debate or adversarial collaboration, where agents with diverse backgrounds and objectives challenge each other's outputs, leading to more robust and falsifiable scientific assessments. The theory asserts that diversity in evaluators and structured adversarial interactions accelerate the identification of flaws and the convergence on high-quality scientific theories.</p>

                <li>Iterative critique and defense cycles will reduce the rate of undetected errors in LLM-generated scientific theories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal balance of human and LLM agents for maximal theory quality is unknown and may vary by domain.</li>
                <li>Adversarial evaluation may sometimes entrench disagreement or polarization, especially in controversial scientific domains.</li>
                <li>Multi-agent adversarial evaluation may surface novel, previously unrecognized scientific hypotheses.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If adversarial, diverse evaluation teams do not outperform homogeneous or non-adversarial teams in flaw detection, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If iterative critique cycles do not increase falsifiability or explanatory power, the refinement law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If adversarial debate leads to lower theory quality or increased error rates, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of adversarial dynamics on evaluator motivation and potential for gaming or strategic misrepresentation is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The effect of LLMs with similar training data or biases on the diversity benefit is not explicitly modeled. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
