                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Symbolic Reasoning in Language Models for Spatial Puzzles</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) develop emergent, distributed representations that approximate symbolic reasoning over spatial constraints when solving puzzle games like Sudoku. Rather than explicit rule-based logic, the models encode and manipulate abstracted constraint structures through their internal activations, enabling them to generalize to novel puzzles and constraint types.</p>

                <li>If LLMs fail to generalize to novel puzzles with the same constraint structure, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If probing fails to reveal any internal encoding of constraint satisfaction, the theory would be called into question.</li>
