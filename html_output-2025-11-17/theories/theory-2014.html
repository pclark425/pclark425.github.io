                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Abstraction of Reviewer Feedback Laws</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large corpora of peer review texts, can autonomously abstract qualitative laws that govern the structure, content, and influence of reviewer feedback in scientific peer review. The theory asserts that LLMs can generalize across disciplines and venues to identify recurring patterns and principles that underlie reviewer judgments, feedback framing, and their impact on editorial decisions.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will identify that requests for additional experiments are a recurring feedback pattern across STEM fields.</li>
                <li>LLMs will abstract laws indicating that negative feedback on novelty is a strong predictor of rejection recommendations.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may uncover discipline-specific feedback laws that have not been previously formalized.</li>
                <li>LLMs could reveal that certain feedback patterns are predictive of editorial reversals, not just initial decisions.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to identify recurring feedback patterns in large peer review corpora, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLM-abstracted laws do not generalize across disciplines or venues, the theory's generalizability is undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of non-textual factors (e.g., author reputation, institutional prestige) in editorial decisions is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory is somewhat related to existing work but introduces a novel law abstraction framing.</p>
