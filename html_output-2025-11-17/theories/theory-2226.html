                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Evaluative Calibration Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most effective when the evaluation process itself is subject to meta-evaluation and calibration. By systematically tracking evaluator performance, disagreement rates, and calibration metrics, the system can adaptively adjust trust, escalate review, and identify when new evaluation protocols are needed, leading to a self-improving evaluation ecosystem.</p>
