                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Selective Forecasting and Uncertainty Hedging Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can achieve accurate probability estimates for future scientific discoveries by selectively focusing on high-signal, low-noise informational cues in the scientific literature and discourse, while explicitly hedging against epistemic uncertainty through structured self-critique and scenario diversification. The theory asserts that LLMs' ability to filter, weigh, and synthesize diverse sources, combined with explicit mechanisms for uncertainty quantification, enables robust forecasting even in the face of incomplete or ambiguous evidence.</p>
