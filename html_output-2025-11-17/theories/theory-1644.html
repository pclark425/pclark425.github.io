                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Simulation Fidelity Boundaries: The Interplay of Model Scale, Alignment, and Prompt/Context Design</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the fidelity of LLM-based scientific simulation is fundamentally bounded by the nonlinear interactions among three core factors: model scale (size and capacity), alignment (domain-specific adaptation and instruction-following), and prompt/context design (how information and queries are structured). The theory asserts that these factors interact in both synergistic and antagonistic ways, and that their optimal configuration is subdomain-dependent, leading to distinct fidelity boundaries for different scientific tasks.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For a given scientific subdomain, there exists a threshold in prompt/context design quality below which increasing scale or alignment yields little improvement in simulation fidelity.</li>
                <li>In subdomains with high symbolic structure, improvements in alignment and prompt design will yield greater fidelity gains than scale alone.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist subdomains where the interaction of scale, alignment, and prompt design produces emergent simulation capabilities not predictable from any single factor.</li>
                <li>Novel prompt/context designs could enable high-fidelity simulation in subdomains previously thought inaccessible to LLMs, even at moderate scale and alignment.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If simulation fidelity in a subdomain increases linearly with scale, regardless of alignment or prompt/context, the nonlinear interaction law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If all subdomains show identical fidelity boundaries regardless of their structure, the subdomain-dependent boundary law is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of external tool integration (e.g., calculators, retrieval) on simulation fidelity boundaries is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The role of training data diversity and recency is not explicitly modeled in the boundary function. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
