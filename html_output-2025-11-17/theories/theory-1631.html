                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1631</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck and Noise Sensitivity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the simulation accuracy of LLMs in scientific subdomains is fundamentally limited by the information bottleneck imposed by pretraining and fine-tuning data, and by the model's sensitivity to noise and ambiguity in both input prompts and training data. The theory asserts that simulation accuracy is maximized when the information bottleneck is minimized (i.e., when all relevant domain information is present and accessible) and when the model's robustness to noise is high.</p>
