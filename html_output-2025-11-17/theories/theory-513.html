                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Monte Carlo Tree Search with LLM-Derived Reward for Scientific Hypothesis Generation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLMs can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Integrating large language models (LLMs) as numeric reward oracles within a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework enables efficient, scalable exploration and optimization of complex scientific hypothesis spaces (such as catalyst design). The stochastic search policy and repeated querying of the LLM allow the system to overcome the limitations of single-pass, chain-of-thought, or self-consistency prompting, yielding more specific, higher-reward, and more diverse candidate discoveries. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to rapidly generate and score hypotheses, even when the LLM's reward estimates are noisy or uncalibrated, and can be further enhanced by combining LLM-derived rewards with simulation-based feedback.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Applying MCTS with LLM-derived reward to a new scientific domain (e.g., drug discovery, materials design) will yield more specific and higher-scoring candidates than single-pass, chain-of-thought, or self-consistency LLM prompting.</li>

                <li>If LLM-derived reward is found to be systematically misleading (e.g., due to hallucination, bias, or lack of domain knowledge), leading to poor or unsafe discoveries, the surrogate law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If integrating simulation-based feedback with MCTS+LLM does not improve the quality or novelty of discoveries compared to MCTS+LLM alone, the predicted synergy would be falsified.</li>
