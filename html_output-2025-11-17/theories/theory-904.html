                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by dynamically integrating hierarchical episodic (event-based) and semantic (fact-based) memory representations. The agent constructs and maintains a multi-level memory structure, where low-level episodic traces (specific actions and observations) are abstracted into higher-level semantic knowledge (rules, object properties, world models), and retrieval is contextually modulated to balance specificity and generalization. This enables efficient reasoning, planning, and adaptation to novel game scenarios.</p>
