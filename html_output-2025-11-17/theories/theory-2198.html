                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2198</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most robust when conducted through an iterative, interactive process involving both human experts and AI systems. The process alternates between automated, criteria-based scoring (e.g., logical consistency, empirical plausibility) and human judgment (e.g., domain relevance, interpretability), with each round refining the evaluation based on feedback from the other. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both AI (scalability, consistency) and humans (contextual understanding, value judgment), and is particularly suited to the unique challenges posed by LLM-generated outputs.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The hybrid process may reveal new types of theory flaws unique to LLMs that are not easily detected by either humans or AI alone.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If alternating human-AI evaluation does not outperform single-mode evaluation (human or AI alone), the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If iterative feedback does not improve theory quality or error detection, the theory's assumptions are challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Potential for feedback loops to reinforce human or AI biases is not addressed. </li>
