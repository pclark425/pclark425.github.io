                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Scientific Trajectory Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can measure the probability of future scientific discoveries by modeling latent trajectories of scientific concepts, hypotheses, and research activity within high-dimensional semantic space. By tracking the movement, clustering, and divergence of these trajectories over time, LLMs can infer the momentum, convergence, or stagnation of scientific ideas, and thus estimate the likelihood of imminent breakthroughs or discoveries.</p>

            <ol>

                <li>If LLMs cannot distinguish between converging and diverging trajectories in practice, the theory is falsified.</li>
