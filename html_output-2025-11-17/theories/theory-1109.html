                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Iterative Self-Verification for Logical Soundness in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that strict logical reasoning in LMs is best achieved when the model employs iterative self-verification: after generating a candidate reasoning step or solution, the LM re-evaluates its own output using explicit logical rules or meta-reasoning, correcting errors and ensuring soundness before proceeding. This process can be internal (via auxiliary modules) or external (via prompting or tool use), and is essential for minimizing logical fallacies and hallucinations.</p>
