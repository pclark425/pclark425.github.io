                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Deliberate Memory Control and Self-Improvement Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents can achieve self-improvement and enhanced task performance by deliberately controlling the storage, retrieval, and recombination of both factual and procedural memories. By treating memory not just as a passive store but as an active substrate for cognitive adaptation, LLM agents can dynamically reconfigure their reasoning, planning, and learning processes to better address novel or evolving tasks. The theory emphasizes the importance of meta-cognitive routines, memory pruning, and the strategic use of episodic and semantic memory to facilitate transfer learning, error correction, and the invention of new strategies.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Human cognition leverages memory to adapt strategies for new problems; LLMs can synthesize new plans from memory fragments (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting, program synthesis). </li>
    <li>Meta-learning and self-reflective agents adapt their learning strategies by recalling and modifying prior routines. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to case-based reasoning and meta-learning, the law's focus on deliberate, dynamic memory control for self-improvement in LLMs is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Case-based reasoning, meta-learning, and program synthesis involve adaptation via memory.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit law of deliberate, agent-controlled memory-driven cognitive reconfiguration in LLMs is novel.</p>
