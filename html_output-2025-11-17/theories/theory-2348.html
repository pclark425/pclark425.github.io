                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2348</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Peripheral Systemic Trigger Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is initiated or accelerated by chronic peripheral systemic factors—such as metabolic syndrome, chronic infection, or gut dysbiosis—that induce a pro-inflammatory state, disrupt blood-brain barrier integrity, and trigger central amyloid and tau pathology. Early detection should focus on peripheral biomarkers and systemic signatures, enabling intervention before irreversible brain changes occur.</p>
