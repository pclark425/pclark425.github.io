                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit Formalization and Verification Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language models achieve optimal strict logical reasoning when their outputs are explicitly mapped to formal logic representations (e.g., first-order logic), and these representations are verified by an external or internal logic engine. The theory posits that the process of translating natural language to formal logic, followed by automated verification, is essential for ensuring logical soundness and consistency in LM reasoning.</p>
