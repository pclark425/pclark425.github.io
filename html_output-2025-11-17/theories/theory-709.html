                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models, when sufficiently large and/or trained with appropriate data and objectives, can develop internal representations that approximate algorithmic reasoning for arithmetic tasks. This theory posits that, beyond memorization, LMs can learn to simulate stepwise computation through their attention and token processing mechanisms, especially when prompted with chain-of-thought or step-by-step instructions.</p>
