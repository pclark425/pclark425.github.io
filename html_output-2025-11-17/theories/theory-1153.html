                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit Intermediate Representation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve strict logical reasoning best when they are required to generate, manipulate, and verify explicit intermediate representations (EIRs) of logical structure, such as formal logic trees, symbolic expressions, or stepwise derivations. The theory asserts that the act of externalizing and manipulating these representations, either internally or via external modules, enables LMs to avoid common pitfalls of implicit, distributed reasoning and to maintain logical consistency and verifiability throughout the reasoning process.</p>
