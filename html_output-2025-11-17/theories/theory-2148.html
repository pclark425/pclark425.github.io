                <p><strong>Name:</strong> HSLDT: Semantic-Formal Synergy Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the synergy between LLMs' semantic understanding and symbolic systems' formal rigor enables the extraction of both explicit and implicit scientific theories from text. LLMs excel at capturing nuanced, context-dependent meanings and latent relationships, while symbolic systems enforce logical consistency and formal structure, together enabling the distillation of robust, generalizable scientific knowledge.</p>
