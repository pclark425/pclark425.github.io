                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Precision-Weighted Format Arbitration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual format arbitration operates hierarchically: at lower levels, sensory and motor formats are selected based on their precision for immediate perceptual or action tasks; at higher levels, symbolic and abstract formats are selected for reasoning and planning. Arbitration at each level is governed by a precision-weighted mechanism, and information can be passed up or down the hierarchy as needed.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Tasks that degrade lower-level format precision (e.g., visual noise) will increase reliance on higher-level formats (e.g., verbal reasoning) for the same concept.</li>
                <li>Neuroimaging will show increased activation in higher-order brain regions when lower-level format precision is experimentally reduced.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training to increase lower-level format precision (e.g., perceptual learning) will reduce reliance on higher-level formats for conceptual tasks.</li>
                <li>Disorders affecting hierarchical processing (e.g., schizophrenia) will show abnormal patterns of format arbitration and cross-level precision propagation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reducing lower-level format precision does not increase higher-level format use, the theory's hierarchical arbitration is called into question.</li>
                <li>If neuroimaging does not show predicted shifts in activation across hierarchical levels, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The theory does not specify how arbitration signals are computed or communicated between levels. </li>
