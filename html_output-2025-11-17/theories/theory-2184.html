                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that explicitly assesses theories along several orthogonal axes, such as logical consistency, empirical adequacy, novelty, explanatory power, and ethical/societal impact. The theory asserts that robust evaluation is only possible when all relevant dimensions are systematically and transparently considered, and that trade-offs between dimensions must be made explicit.</p>

<ol>
    <li>In scientific theory choice, trade-offs between simplicity and explanatory power, or between novelty and empirical adequacy, are often necessary and must be justified. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Some dimensions (e.g., ethical impact) may be difficult to quantify or may interact in unexpected ways with others.</li>
                <li>Explicit trade-off documentation may change the way scientific theories are developed or selected.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-dimension evaluation consistently outperforms multi-dimensional frameworks in identifying theory quality, the orthogonality law is undermined.</li>
                <li>If making trade-offs explicit does not improve transparency or trust, the explicit trade-off law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to resolve conflicts when trade-offs between dimensions are irreconcilable. </li>
    <li>The impact of subjective weighting of dimensions is not addressed. </li>
