                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-720</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Circuit Augmentation Theory of Arithmetic Fine-Tuning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that fine-tuning language models on arithmetic tasks induces the formation and strengthening of distributed, task-specific latent circuits—composed of attention heads, MLPs, and their interactions—that encode algorithmic subroutines such as digit alignment, carry/borrow propagation, and digit-wise computation. The augmentation of these circuits is both necessary and sufficient for robust generalization to novel arithmetic problems, and their structure reflects the compositional and hierarchical nature of arithmetic algorithms.</p>
