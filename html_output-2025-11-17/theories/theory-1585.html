                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information-Theoretic Shortcuts for Macroscopic FTL Transport</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL travel could be achieved by leveraging information-theoretic shortcuts, such as quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, and emergent macroscopic nonlocality. By encoding the quantum state of a spacecraft and its contents, and reconstructing it at a distant location using engineered macroscopic entanglement, effective FTL transport is realized. The process relies on advances in quantum information, error correction, and macroscopic entanglement, and may be feasible with current or near-future quantum technologies. The theory explicitly addresses the challenges of decoherence, the no-signaling theorem, and the need for classical information transfer, and explores whether engineered loopholes or new protocols could circumvent these barriers for practical FTL transport.</p>
