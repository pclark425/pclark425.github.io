                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance Filtering for Efficient Memory Use in LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by employing contextual relevance filtering: continuously evaluating the relevance of stored information to the current game state and task, and prioritizing retrieval and retention of only the most contextually pertinent memories. This minimizes distraction from irrelevant details and maximizes the agent's ability to focus on actionable knowledge.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Contextual filtering may enable agents to ignore adversarially inserted distractors in deceptive games.</li>
                <li>Over-filtering may cause agents to miss subtle but important cues, leading to new failure modes.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
