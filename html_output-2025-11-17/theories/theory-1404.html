                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Alignment Theory of Language Model Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-alignment, in which each reflection step acts as a feedback loop. The model compares its output to internalized standards of correctness, coherence, and relevance, and adjusts subsequent generations to better align with these standards. This process is analogous to a form of self-supervised learning occurring at inference time, leveraging the model's own knowledge and reasoning capabilities.</p>
