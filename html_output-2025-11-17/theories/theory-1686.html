                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Law of Feedback Loop and Syntax/Error Reporting in Code-Generating LLM Simulators</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as code-generating simulators in scientific subdomains is governed by a feedback loop between the model's internal syntax/error detection mechanisms and the explicit error reporting provided by the simulated environment. The interplay between these two feedback sources determines the model's ability to self-correct, refine, and converge on accurate code outputs, especially in complex or unfamiliar scientific domains.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LLMs improve code accuracy when provided with explicit error messages and allowed to iteratively refine outputs. </li>
    <li>LLMs with internal error detection (e.g., self-consistency checks) perform better in code tasks. </li>
    <li>Iterative code generation with feedback loops leads to higher success rates in code synthesis benchmarks. </li>
    <li>In scientific code generation, LLMs that leverage both external error messages and internal validation outperform those using only one source. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While feedback and error correction are known, the explicit feedback loop between internal and external error detection as a governing law for simulator accuracy is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that feedback and error messages improve LLM code generation, and that self-consistency boosts performance.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the interaction between external (environmental) and internal (model-based) feedback as a feedback loop, and posits their amplification effect on accuracy.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In highly novel scientific domains with fundamentally new error types, the feedback loop may lead to emergent self-correction strategies not present in training data.</li>
                <li>If error reporting is artificially randomized or adversarial, the feedback loop may destabilize, potentially leading to oscillatory or divergent code outputs.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple weak feedback sources (e.g., partial error messages and partial internal checks) may result in non-linear improvements or unexpected failure modes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM simulator with strong internal error detection is placed in an environment with no error reporting, and still achieves high accuracy, this would challenge the necessity of the feedback loop.</li>
                <li>If providing more detailed error messages does not improve code generation accuracy, the amplification law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs in ambiguous error environments converge as quickly as those in explicit error environments, the bottleneck law would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs generate correct code without any error feedback or internal error detection are not explained by this theory. </li>
    <li>LLMs that memorize and regurgitate code snippets without iterative feedback may achieve high accuracy in narrow domains, which is not captured by the feedback loop framework. </li>
