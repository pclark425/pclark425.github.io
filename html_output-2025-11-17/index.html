Rather than a strictly linear cascade, these processes interact in positive feedback loops, where each can initiate or amplify the others. The earliest detectable changes may be metabolic (mitochondrial/energy deficits and subtle inflammation), which then facilitate Aβ and tau pathology. The interplay between these axes, modulated by genetic and environmental risk factors, determines the rate and regional pattern of neurodegeneration.

However, gains diminish rapidly when ρ < 0.5 or cost ratio < 3x. The choice of multi-fidelity surrogate model matters: coregionalization methods (ICM with shared kernels, PCM with empirical correlations) provide better practical tradeoffs than full multivariate models (MGP) when inter-fidelity relationships are approximately linear and training data is limited, due to lower hyperparameter complexity. Allocation should be adaptive: early exploration uses low-fidelity extensively, while late-stage exploitation and final validation require high-fidelity.

The relationship is complex: computational domains with sub-minute feedback cycles show 2-5x improvements over text-only approaches, while physical execution domains show more modest gains due to additional constraints. Three factors interact: (1) feedback latency (time to get results), (2) execution reliability (probability of successful execution), and (3) execution informativeness (quality of error messages and metrics). Systems achieve highest success when all three factors are optimized, with latency being most critical for computational tasks and reliability being most critical for physical tasks.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Systems can overcome high complexity if sufficient high-quality data is available for training or retrieval, but the required data volume scales super-linearly with problem complexity. The scaling relationship is approximately D ∝ C^α where D is required data volume, C is problem complexity, and α typically ranges from 1.2 to 2.5 depending on domain structure and prior strength. Systems with strong domain priors (physics, mathematics) can reduce data requirements by 10-100x compared to domain-agnostic approaches. Below critical data thresholds (varying by domain from 100 to 10,000 examples), success rates drop precipitously regardless of model capacity. Data quality dominates quantity below ~100k examples, while quantity becomes more important above ~1M examples. Retrieval-augmented approaches and meta-learning can partially decouple training data requirements from inference-time performance, creating distinct operational regimes where different system architectures dominate.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Specifically: Local convolutional architectures (spherical CNNs, standard CNNs with appropriate projections) are effective for capturing regional features and patterns with characteristic scales <1000-2000 km, but suffer from information loss through pooling when global teleconnections dominate. Fully-connected architectures can capture arbitrary global patterns but require substantially more training data and have O(N²) computational scaling. Global attention mechanisms (transformers, AFNO) can capture long-range dependencies more efficiently than fully-connected layers but still require more data than local architectures. The optimal choice depends on the problem's spatial scale structure, with hybrid architectures often providing the best trade-offs for problems with mixed local and global features.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The optimal operating point on this trade-off curve depends on: (1) the maturity and coverage of training data relative to the target design space, (2) the cost and throughput of experimental validation, (3) the availability and accuracy of surrogate models or physics-based filters for post-generation validation, and (4) the computational cost of generation itself. Physics-informed generative models (incorporating symmetries, conservation laws, or physical constraints) and hybrid approaches (combining unconstrained generation with physics-based filtering or refinement) achieve better fidelity-diversity trade-offs than purely data-driven generation, but at the cost of increased model complexity and potential reduction in the accessible design space. Active learning and closed-loop optimization can dynamically navigate this trade-off by using experimental feedback to refine the generative model's focus.

Models that reconstruct all observable details waste representational capacity and computational resources, leading to worse task performance than models that selectively encode task-relevant features. However, effective task-alignment typically requires supervision, privileged information, or explicit task signals (though minimal supervision of 1-5% is often sufficient). The optimal abstraction is frequently hybrid and multi-level, combining different abstraction types for different purposes (e.g., latent dynamics for prediction, geometric for spatial reasoning, semantic for object identity, temporal modeling for sequential dependencies, and pixel-level for verification or when fine visual details encode task information). Dynamic adaptation of abstraction at test time can improve robustness to distribution shifts. There exist lower bounds below which excessive abstraction discards task-relevant information. Benefits manifest as improved sample efficiency, robustness to distractors, and task performance, though computational costs and transfer capabilities depend on implementation details and domain characteristics.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-147.html">[theory-147]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

This allocation can be either static (precomputed based on task analysis) or dynamic (input-conditioned), with the choice depending on task stability, computational constraints, and whether task structure is well-understood. The principle posits that world models achieve optimality through selective fidelity: high-resolution representations for task-critical features and compressed, abstract representations for task-peripheral information, creating a heterogeneous representational landscape where computational resources, interpretability, and predictive accuracy are concentrated along task-relevant dimensions. Critically, the mechanism of implementation is as important as the principle itself: token-space adaptation, attention-based reweighting, and properly regularized modular composition show superior efficiency/performance profiles compared to naive parameter duplication, which can severely harm performance. Benefits are most pronounced with heterogeneous tasks (measured by gradient conflict or domain diversity), constrained resources, and non-stationary distributions, but diminish with homogeneous tasks, abundant resources, or very high capacity.

The gap between proxy performance and ground-truth validation creates a systematic bias where systems appear more successful in computational or simulated evaluation than in real-world validation. This gap varies systematically with: (1) the novelty and extrapolation distance of the discovery from training distributions, (2) the maturity and physical grounding of the proxy metric, (3) the domain's amenability to computational modeling, (4) temporal and distributional shifts between training and deployment, and (5) the validation architecture (closed-loop experimental feedback vs batch proxy-then-validate workflows). Closed-loop systems with tight experimental feedback can achieve smaller effective gaps through iterative refinement, though gaps are not eliminated. The computational cost advantage of proxy evaluation creates economic incentives to defer ground-truth validation, leading to accumulation of unvalidated discoveries.

Proxy metrics are calibrated on historical data that predominantly reflects incremental science, creating training distribution bias that causes systematic misvaluation of transformational work.

The gap arises because transformational discoveries violate multiple implicit assumptions embedded in proxy metrics simultaneously (citation patterns, journal prestige, author reputation, methodological familiarity), with these violations compounding in evaluator-dependent ways. Critically, the gap is not merely noise but systematic bias that can be partially corrected through meta-learning approaches that model transformation degree, evaluator characteristics, and field factors, though correction mechanisms face a fundamental tradeoff: standardization that reduces evaluator disagreement may suppress the heterodox judgments needed to identify paradigm-shifting work.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-320.html">[theory-320]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

This asymmetry is architectural and domain-dependent rather than fundamental, manifesting in three distinct forms: (1) Implementation Gap - between code/protocol generation and executable validation, (2) Conceptual Gap - between hypothesis generation and logical/theoretical verification, and (3) Empirical Gap - between prediction generation and experimental confirmation. The gap size is determined by three primary factors: novelty level (N), system architecture quality (A), and domain formalization (D). Generation capabilities scale with pattern recognition and extrapolation from training data, allowing systems to produce increasingly novel outputs. Validation capabilities depend on: (1) precedent-based comparison (which decays with novelty), (2) formal verification methods (available in formal domains), (3) empirical ground truth (costly for novel claims), and (4) architectural validation infrastructure (designable and non-decaying). The critical insight is that the gap is not an inherent limitation but an architectural choice: systems with dedicated validation modules, formal verification capabilities, closed-loop experimental feedback, or strategic human-AI collaboration can substantially reduce or eliminate the gap even for highly novel outputs. However, without such architectural investments, the gap widens systematically with novelty. The gap manifests as: systems generating plausible-seeming claims without epistemic tools to assess validity; higher validation failure rates for novel discoveries in poorly-architected systems; reliance on surface-level plausibility checks rather than deep validity assessment; systematic implementation failures preventing validation attempts; and false positive rates that increase with novelty in systems lacking validation infrastructure. The theory predicts that validation computational costs exceed generation costs and increase with novelty, but this asymmetry can be managed through efficient validation infrastructure design.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-318.html">[theory-318]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The original theory correctly identified an evidence gap in the dataset regarding circuit simulator requirements; extensive new evidence has now filled this gap with detailed documentation across analog, digital, RF, and neuromorphic domains. The evidence establishes that: (1) SPICE-level simulation with foundry-calibrated transistor device models (BSIM, PDK models) is the standard baseline; (2) parasitic modeling (interconnect R/C, layout-dependent effects) is required for accurate predictions, especially at high frequencies; (3) domain randomization through PVT corners and Monte Carlo sampling is essential for robust designs that tolerate manufacturing variations; (4) foundry PDK calibration provides significantly more realistic results than generic SPICE models; (5) multi-fidelity approaches using ML surrogates trained on SPICE achieve 1000x+ speedup with <8% error; (6) different domains have distinct requirements (mm-wave requiring EM effects, analog sizing requiring hierarchical mismatch modeling, neuromorphic benefiting from event-based abstraction). However, the original theory's caution about empirical validation remains fully justified: NO sim-to-real hardware transfer experiments exist in any of the 30+ studies reviewed, leaving the sufficiency of these simulation requirements for actual hardware deployment completely unvalidated.

Proxy performance follows a clear hierarchy: (1) Traditional absolute proxies (raw citation counts, absolute semantic density, standard peer review) show large gaps with severe cross-domain degradation (AUROC drops from 0.75-0.85 to 0.36-0.40, representing 40-50 percentage point degradation); (2) Relative proxies (Relative Neighbor Density, percentile-based metrics) show minimal gaps with stable cross-domain performance (AUROC 0.795-0.820 across domains, <5% degradation); (3) Information-augmented proxies (LLMs with external literature retrieval, structured multi-stage analysis) show intermediate performance (AUROC 0.6-0.8 depending on domain and information quality). Correction mechanisms show mechanism-specific effectiveness: meta-learning with adaptive bias-aware alignment and entropy weighting reduces prediction error by up to 92% (MSE from 0.1191 to 0.0093); structured extraction with literature retrieval improves alignment by 20-40 percentage points (86.5% reasoning alignment vs 65.1% human-human baseline); relative normalization maintains stable cross-domain performance where absolute metrics fail. The effectiveness of correction depends on: (1) matching the mechanism to the specific failure mode, (2) quality and coverage of external information, (3) sophistication of normalization or meta-learning, and (4) within-domain vs cross-domain application.

Traditional proxies are calibrated on historical data that predominantly reflects incremental science, creating systematic bias against work that violates implicit assumptions embedded in these metrics. The undervaluation arises because transformational discoveries simultaneously violate multiple proxy assumptions: they lack immediate citation recognition, may be published in non-traditional venues, often come from unexpected sources, and use novel methodologies. The magnitude and pattern of this gap is highly context-dependent, modulated by presentation quality (20-60 percentage point effects), task framing, field receptivity, and author reputation. Traditional proxies show gaps ranging from moderate (20-40% undervaluation) for work violating some assumptions to severe (60%+ undervaluation or rejection) for work violating multiple assumptions simultaneously. However, the gap is not inherent to automated evaluation—well-designed alternative proxies can substantially reduce or eliminate these gaps, indicating the problem is one of proxy architecture rather than fundamental limitations of automation.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-320.html">[theory-320]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Systems that generate fabricated or purely simulated results without appropriate domain-specific validation create a systematic gap between reported performance and actual scientific validity. This gap is particularly problematic because: (1) fabricated results cannot be independently verified, (2) systems may hallucinate plausible but incorrect findings, (3) the distinction between genuine discovery and convincing fabrication becomes blurred, and (4) domain norms for valid evidence vary significantly. The appropriate validation method depends critically on the domain: formal computational proof provides exact validation in mathematics and formal logic; high-fidelity simulation validated against extensive experimental data can achieve near-experimental accuracy in well-characterized computational domains (e.g., protein structure prediction, orbital mechanics); experimental validation is essential in empirical sciences. Hybrid validation approaches—combining computational screening with experimental confirmation—represent best practice for bridging the gap in empirical sciences. Effective validation requires: (1) domain-appropriate validation methods, (2) calibrated uncertainty quantification, (3) validation infrastructure (benchmarks, verification suites, provenance systems), and (4) clear labeling of validation status.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-161.html">[theory-161]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The gap manifests most severely in systems using unconstrained generation architectures operating in empirical domains on transformational discoveries, where validated success rates fall to 0.2-3%. Conversely, systems using constrained generation in formal domains can achieve >90% validated success rates even for novel outputs. The gap arises from multiple distinct failure modes: calibration failures (overconfidence in incorrect outputs), tool availability limitations (lack of formal verification methods), resource constraints (expensive experiments), and architectural choices (unconstrained generation). In empirical domains with unconstrained generation, the gap creates a 'plausibility trap' where transformational claims are assessed primarily on surface-level coherence rather than deep validity, as systems lack the epistemic tools to assess their validity rigorously.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-318.html">[theory-318]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Two distinct fidelity requirements exist: (1) Verification fidelity—the simulation accuracy needed to reliably predict real-world performance during design validation, and (2) Transfer learning fidelity—the minimal simulation fidelity needed to train models that successfully transfer to real hardware. The evidence establishes detailed verification fidelity practices (industrial SPICE with foundry PDKs, PVT corners, hierarchical mismatch modeling, post-layout parasitic extraction for analog circuits; simplified Ngspice models for power converters) but provides no empirical validation of transfer learning fidelity requirements since no sim-to-real transfer experiments exist for any circuit type. Domain-specific fidelity approaches are documented: analog sizing/placement uses high-fidelity industrial SPICE with comprehensive variation modeling, while power converter topology generation uses simplified fixed-parameter models. A two-phase training strategy is demonstrated where agents train on small sampled subsets of high-fidelity simulations then verify with full Monte Carlo.

Gap magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction of: (1) training regime (episodic meta-learning, curriculum with explicit compositional structure, or standard supervised training), (2) coverage of compositional patterns (k-coverage: multiple shared contexts providing functional equivalence evidence), (3) task structure (autoregressive compositional, path-ambiguous, or tree-structured), (4) compositional depth/complexity, and (5) architectural support for composition. The coverage principle provides the underlying mechanism: compositional generalization requires k-coverage with data requirements scaling as |X|^c where c≈2-3 for depth-2 compositions, invariant to model parameter scale but reducible through architectural innovations like Chain-of-Thought representation (which decomposes multi-hop into sequential single-hop steps). Under standard supervised training without explicit compositional structure, gaps range from moderate (20-40%) for shallow compositions to severe (50-80%) for deep linguistic/semantic compositions (≥3 supporting facts) and specific structural phenomena (attraction errors, negation-of-operators, path-ambiguous structures). Episodic meta-learning or curriculum strategies providing explicit compositional structure reduce gaps substantially (to 10-20% for linguistic/visual domains). Hierarchical architectures with input-adaptive recurrence, latent algorithmic supervision, discrete bottlenecks, and self-correction achieve near-perfect transfer (gaps <5%) in procedural domains. Path ambiguity (variables affecting output through multiple computational paths) represents a fundamental task-structure property requiring near-exhaustive combinations or explicit variable-binding mechanisms. Linear decodability of constituent representations in hidden activations serves as a diagnostic indicator of compositional success across domains. Transfer success depends critically on competency alignment between source and target tasks (2-15× gains when aligned, 10-30% degradation when misaligned).<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-177.html">[theory-177]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Representation often provides equal or greater benefits than operator sophistication alone. Learned operators—particularly those based on large pre-trained models—can access richer hypothesis spaces by leveraging statistical patterns from large corpora, but simultaneously narrow search trajectories through training priors. They implicitly encode domain-specific heuristics that improve both novelty and executability when the target domain aligns with training distribution. However, they exhibit systematic bias toward training patterns that can cause catastrophic failure on out-of-distribution problems, require higher computational cost (manageable through ensemble strategies, selective invocation, early stopping), and necessitate robust validation infrastructure (hallucination checks, oracle evaluators, fallback mechanisms). Adaptation occurs primarily through prompt engineering and in-context learning rather than online fine-tuning. Traditional operators remain competitive in many domains, especially with appropriate representations and constraints. Learned operators' benefits are most pronounced when: (1) target domain has strong statistical regularities present in training data, (2) evaluation is expensive relative to operator cost, (3) search space is large and poorly structured, and (4) robust validation can be implemented. Hybrid approaches combining learned, traditional, and formal operators can achieve better novelty-executability trade-offs, but optimal mixing is highly problem-dependent.

Effective operator learning requires three integrated components: (1) a structured hypothesis space with appropriate inductive biases, (2) semantic feedback mechanisms capturing behavioral and functional properties beyond syntactic structure, and (3) regularization mechanisms controlling complexity and preventing pathological behaviors. Operators encode implicit theories about productive variation and can be learned to balance exploration-exploitation through context-dependent selection policies, compositional structures, and multi-dimensional specialization (per-individual, per-dataset, per-stage, per-modality). The hypothesis space is structured by domain constraints (syntactic validity, executability) and learning objectives (novelty, fitness, diversity). Operator learning exhibits characteristic trade-offs between generality and specialization, learning cost and search efficiency, and different adaptation timescales.

Bloat emerges through multiple mechanisms: (1) protection of functional building blocks from destructive crossover, (2) provision of neutral variation space, and (3) editing distance dynamics where additions are more likely than deletions to reduce distance to optima, creating local selection pressure for growth even with balanced add/remove operator rates. The magnitude of bloat effects is quantified by neutral bloating factors (Ω) and non-neutral bloating factors (Λ), which grow exponentially with program size. Bloat can increase executability by protecting building blocks and maintain diversity through neutral variation, but excessive bloat reduces interpretability and evaluation efficiency. Aggressive bloat control improves executability and efficiency but can reduce diversity by eliminating neutral variations and disrupt building blocks. The optimal balance depends on problem characteristics, representation type, operator configuration (including mutation step size/operator strength), and initialization strategy. Effective systems use adaptive bloat control combined with appropriate initialization (small programs to reduce expected editing distance to optima) and operator tuning that maintains sufficient diversity for exploration while preventing runaway growth. The relationship between bloat and outcomes is representation-dependent: tree-based representations show stronger bloat effects than linear genomes, which exhibit structural introns that protect identifiable exons while enabling register-based building block reuse.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-182.html">[theory-182]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The required modeling depth depends on: (1) task dynamics (quasi-static vs dynamic), (2) control mode (position vs torque vs impedance), (3) control frequency, and (4) whether low-level controllers abstract actuator details. Critical actuator properties include: torque/force limits and saturation, electrical/mechanical dynamics (motor constants, gear ratios, transmission efficiency), control latencies and delays (typically 5-50ms), friction and backlash, and for compliant tasks, backdrivability and transmission efficiency. Complete omission of actuator dynamics causes transfer failure for locomotion and high-speed manipulation, but tasks using operational-space control or position control with low-level PD controllers can succeed with simplified actuator models. System identification of key actuator parameters from encoder-only data (20-40 seconds of excitation covering control bandwidth typically sufficient) can enable zero-shot transfer. Physics-based actuator models with compact parameterizations (5-10 parameters) outperform learned neural network models, requiring less data, no torque sensors, and providing better generalization. Actuator parameter randomization can improve robustness when accurate identification is not feasible, but accurate physics-based identification eliminates the need for randomization and achieves superior transfer. Accurate actuator modeling also enables energy-efficient policies with 30%+ reductions in cost-of-transport. In-air actuator identification (without contact) can be sufficient for contact-rich locomotion, suggesting actuator modeling can be decoupled from contact modeling.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-190.html">[theory-190]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Critical Dynamics Fidelity Theory (Revised)<br><b>Description:</b> Successful sim-to-real transfer of manipulation skills for scientific discovery requires high-fidelity modeling of only those dynamics properties that are critical to task success, rather than complete system modeling. The theory posits that there exists a task-dependent subset of dynamics properties (actuator bandwidth, control update frequency, damping, backlash, compliance, inertia, friction, contact model characteristics) that must exceed minimum fidelity thresholds, while other properties can be modeled at lower fidelity without impacting transfer success. Critical parameters are those for which the task performance exhibits high sensitivity (gradient magnitude > threshold), and fidelity requirements scale with the characteristic timescales, force scales, and precision requirements of the task. The theory's applicability depends on task characteristics: it is most relevant for high-acceleration or high-gear-ratio manipulation tasks where actuator dynamics significantly affect performance, while for slow quasi-static manipulation with large tolerances, perceptual and behavioral factors may dominate. This selective fidelity approach enables 2-10x (or greater) more efficient simulation while maintaining transfer performance within 5-10% of uniformly high-fidelity approaches for tasks where dynamics modeling is critical.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-360.html">[theory-360]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The theory proposes that crossover and mutation operations create a dynamic equilibrium where optimizing any two vertices of this triangle necessarily constrains the third, with the degree of constraint depending on operator type, representation, and control mechanisms. The triangle constraint is universal but its geometry and feasible region vary systematically with these factors. Specifically: (1) High diversity with high executability leads to bloat as the system preserves multiple working solutions with redundant components that serve as protective buffers; (2) High executability with low bloat forces low diversity as only compact, similar solutions remain viable; (3) High diversity with low bloat results in low executability as compact, varied solutions often break functional constraints. The genetic operators act as control parameters that navigate this triangle, with their effectiveness varying by type: conventional structural operators exhibit strong constraints (crossover typically 10-50% validity in code generation, mutation better but still limited), while semantic-aware operators partially relax the constraint by expanding the feasible region (grammar-based 60-75%, type-based 70-85%, LLM-based 80-90% validity in tested domains), though fundamental trade-offs persist even with advanced operators. The bloat accumulation mechanism can be formalized through editing distance: fitness supremum grows linearly with editing distance to optimal solutions, and adding components is combinatorially more likely to reduce distance than removing components (asymmetric neutral bloating factors Ω and Λ), creating fundamental growth pressure even with unbiased operators. Selection pressure modulates the executability-bloat edge, while controllable hyperparameters (fitness targets, diversity temperatures, selection pressures, mutation step sizes) enable dynamic navigation of the triangle without eliminating the fundamental constraint. The triangle geometry is representation-dependent: tree-based representations exhibit strong bloat through subtree growth, linear representations show different patterns, and structured/array representations with activation flags can separate genotypic bloat from phenotypic complexity, creating two-layer dynamics.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-344.html">[theory-344]</a><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Proxy metrics are calibrated on historical data that predominantly reflects incremental science, creating 'training distribution bias' that causes automated systems to systematically undervalue transformational work. The gap magnitude G is context-dependent and follows different mathematical relationships: hyperbolic for displacement-based measures (G ≈ d/(1+b) where d is local displacement and b is knowledge burden), power-law for self-citation effects (penalty ∝ (SCR-β)^γ), and threshold/interaction effects for temporal windows. Transformation is characterized by at least three dimensions: (1) displacement vs consolidation, (2) theoretical vs methodological vs empirical contributions, and (3) conceptual vs interdisciplinary vs technical novelty. Gap magnitudes range from minimal (<20%) for within-domain well-calibrated proxies to very large (>60%) for multiple compounding failures. The theory predicts that proxies based on citation patterns, journal prestige, author reputation, and methodological familiarity will show increasing divergence from ground truth as discoveries become more transformational, with magnitude critically dependent on proxy type, field characteristics (paradigm rigidity β), temporal window length, and data quality. The gap represents systematic bias that can be characterized and corrected through multiple complementary approaches including structured retrieval, relative density normalization, field-specific calibration, hybrid human-AI workflows, topological methods, and portfolio strategies.

Three distinct novelty types show qualitatively different proxy-truth relationships: (1) Pioneer novelty (new topics/questions) faces severe undervaluation (60-90% gaps) by short-term proxies, requiring ≥10 years for recognition; (2) Maverick novelty (distant recombination) is often rewarded by proxies (negative gaps of -70% to 0%, representing over-valuation); (3) Vanguard novelty (reinforcing emerging connections) shows moderate reward with diminishing returns (0-40% gaps, inverted-U pattern). These type-specific gaps arise from training distribution bias—systems calibrated on historical data dominated by incremental and recombinatory work systematically misalign with Pioneer work while favoring visible Maverick recombinations. Gap magnitude follows type-specific functions: G_Pioneer(T) ≈ k_P*e^(β_P*T) (exponential), G_Maverick(T) ≈ -k_M*T (linear reward), G_Vanguard(T) ≈ k_V*T - α*T^2 (inverted-U). Gaps are time-dependent with type-specific decay: G(T_type,t) = G(T_type)*e^(-λ_type*t) where λ_Pioneer << λ_Maverick << λ_Vanguard. Multiple proxy failures interact complexly—compounding multiplicatively (burden factor b_p≈119 attenuates displacement by ~1/120), moving in opposite directions (citation vs novelty measures), or showing low correlations (ρ from -0.24 to +0.40). Field effects include both paradigm rigidity (β) and institutional infrastructure (costs, funding structure, dissemination norms, venue effects with variance≈1.0). Critically, gaps are design-dependent: well-designed systems with structured diversity, dynamic knowledge exchange, entropy-weighted training, and extended windows can match or exceed human performance (86.5% vs 65.1% alignment) while still showing some biases.

The theory proposes a dual-mechanism model: high alignment requires threshold levels in all four factors (bottleneck effect), while above-threshold performance exhibits multiplicative synergies, particularly between calibration and bias control. The theory further specifies that evaluation framework design (Likert scale granularity, dimensional decomposition) modulates the expression of these factors. Critically, calibration and bias control are interdependent - effective calibration must explicitly model and correct bias patterns to achieve synergistic gains, with properly integrated approaches yielding 40-67% better alignment than calibration alone.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-202.html">theory-202</a></td>

The theory predicts that sample complexity gains scale with the proportion of the action hierarchy that can be reused without modification. Transfer efficiency depends on three key factors: (a) the alignment between compositional structure of language descriptions in pretraining and hierarchical task structure in the target domain, (b) the semantic consistency of action concepts across domains (same action labels should have similar preconditions and effects), and (c) the separability of high-level planning from low-level sensorimotor control.

Language pretraining induces three key structural properties in learned representations: (1) semantic clustering that groups functionally similar actions, objects, and states; (2) compositional structure that enables systematic generalization to novel combinations; and (3) affordance-aware embeddings that encode likely action-object relationships. These language-shaped representations transform exploration from random search over a flat, unstructured space into guided search over a semantically organized landscape. Specifically, the theory posits that language provides implicit priors about which state-action combinations are plausible (e.g., 'open door' is more likely than 'open sky'), which actions are likely to be relevant in which contexts (e.g., 'push' near movable objects), and which exploration strategies are likely to be fruitful (e.g., trying semantically similar actions when one fails). This reduces sample complexity by pruning the exploration space, providing natural curricula through semantic similarity, and enabling zero-shot or few-shot transfer for actions and object interactions that were described but not demonstrated during pretraining. The magnitude of exploration efficiency gains depends on the alignment between the linguistic structure learned during pretraining and the semantic structure of the target embodied task.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-201.html">theory-201</a></td>

The theory posits that mismatches at higher frequency levels cascade down to affect lower frequency performance through control instabilities and unexpected contact transitions, but low-frequency modeling errors have minimal impact on high-frequency dynamics. The required simulation fidelity level can be determined by analyzing the task's characteristic force variation timescales and the robot's control architecture.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-189.html">theory-189</a></td>

The core principle is that simulation should learn a 'coarse dynamics model' and base policy that captures the nominal, predictable aspects of laboratory tasks, while online residual learning in the real environment corrects for systematic sim-to-real gaps and handles stochastic, unpredictable variations. The theory proposes a decomposition: π_real(s) = π_sim(s) + π_residual(s), where π_sim is frozen after simulation training and π_residual is learned online. The residual policy should be: (1) initialized to zero to ensure safe deployment, (2) constrained in magnitude to prevent large deviations (||π_residual(s)|| ≤ α·||π_sim(s)|| where α starts small and grows with confidence), (3) trained with high sample efficiency using model-based methods or meta-learning, and (4) regularized to remain smooth and generalizable. The theory further specifies that the base policy should achieve at least 60-70% task success in simulation (the 'minimum viable base policy' threshold) before real-world deployment, and that residual learning should focus on correcting systematic biases (e.g., friction, sensor noise, material properties) rather than learning entirely new behaviors. Online adaptation should use a multi-timescale approach: fast adaptation (1-10 trials) for immediate corrections, medium-term adaptation (10-100 trials) for systematic bias correction, and slow adaptation (100+ trials) for rare events and edge cases.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-192.html">theory-192</a></td>

The theory incorporates moderating factors including evaluator expertise, organizational conventions, and the quality of operationalization (e.g., explicit rubrics, concrete scale anchors). It further predicts that hybrid approaches combining objective automated checks with human review of subjective aspects will outperform either approach alone, and that proxy systems may achieve higher agreement with expert consensus than with individual experts on subjective criteria due to their ability to capture central tendencies in training data.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-205.html">theory-205</a></td>

The sample complexity reduction follows a two-stage process: semantic knowledge transfers with minimal samples (O(log n) where n is task complexity), while sensorimotor grounding requires samples proportional to the perceptual complexity gap. The magnitude of reduction is determined by the semantic overlap between domains (measured by shared action vocabulary, object categories, and relational structures) and inversely related to the perceptual alignment gap (measured by the mutual information between text state representations and embodied sensory observations).

The theory predicts that sample complexity gains scale with the degree of action-space alignment, measured by the overlap in causal action graphs and the consistency of state-transition semantics. Critically, the theory proposes that alignment occurs at multiple levels simultaneously: at the goal level (what to achieve), the plan level (sequence of subgoals), and the primitive level (executable actions), with transfer being most effective when alignment exists at all three levels.

The semantic bridge mechanism operates by aligning learned linguistic representations with perceptual features through attention-based or explicit mapping functions that activate when perceptual inputs match expected patterns from text-derived knowledge.

This relationship differs systematically between literature (natural language) and code (formal language) domains due to their differing syntactic constraints, semantic density, and error tolerance.

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Crossover Controversy Resolution Theory<br><b>Description:</b> This theory proposes that the long-standing controversy about crossover effectiveness in genetic programming and ideation systems can be resolved by understanding crossover as a dual-mode operator that dynamically balances between structure-preserving recombination (favoring executability) and structure-disrupting recombination (favoring novelty). The theory posits that crossover's effectiveness depends on its ability to identify and exploit 'semantic coherence boundaries' - natural breakpoints in code or text where recombination is less likely to destroy functional relationships. These boundaries exist at multiple hierarchical levels: in code (token, expression, statement, block, function, module), and in literature (word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, section, document). When crossover operates at these boundaries, it maintains executability while enabling exploration of the novelty space. The controversy arises because traditional uniform crossover ignores these boundaries, leading to inconsistent results across different representations, domains, and evolutionary stages. The resolution lies in adaptive crossover strategies that: (1) learn to identify semantic coherence boundaries through analysis of execution traces, type systems, and semantic embeddings; (2) adjust their behavior based on the current position along the novelty-executability frontier; and (3) shift from structure-disrupting to structure-preserving modes as evolution progresses. In hybrid literature-code systems, the theory extends to propose that crossover must respect both narrative coherence in text and functional coherence in code, with cross-modal boundaries (where text transitions to code) requiring special handling to maintain both semantic meaning and executability.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-185.html">theory-185</a></td>

Scientific discovery tasks naturally decompose into a hierarchy of subtasks with different abstraction levels: strategic planning (hypothesis generation, experimental strategy selection), tactical execution (experimental sequencing, parameter selection, resource allocation), and operational control (physical manipulation, sensor processing, low-level control). Each hierarchical level exhibits different sensitivity to simulation fidelity, with higher-level cognitive tasks being relatively robust to low-level physics inaccuracies, while lower-level sensorimotor tasks require high-fidelity physics simulation. The theory predicts that optimal sim-to-real transfer is achieved through hierarchically-allocated fidelity that matches computational resources to the sensitivity requirements at each level, rather than uniform high fidelity across all aspects. This enables more efficient use of simulation resources and better transfer performance than either uniform low-fidelity or uniform high-fidelity approaches.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-186.html">theory-186</a></td>

The theory proposes that crossover and mutation operations create a dynamic equilibrium where optimizing any two vertices of this triangle necessarily constrains the third, except under special conditions involving semantic-aware operators or alternative selection mechanisms. Specifically: (1) High diversity with high executability leads to bloat as the system preserves multiple working solutions with redundant components that serve as protective buffers; (2) High executability with low bloat forces low diversity as only compact, similar solutions remain viable; (3) High diversity with low bloat results in low executability as compact, varied solutions often break functional constraints. The genetic operators act as control parameters that navigate this triangle: crossover primarily affects the diversity-executability edge (with 50-90% failure rates in producing executable offspring), mutation primarily affects the bloat-diversity edge (maintaining executability better but producing less diversity), while selection pressure modulates the executability-bloat edge (strong selection permits bloat accumulation through intron protection). The triangle constraint can be partially relaxed through semantic-aware operators, lexicase selection, or grammar-based constraints, which effectively modify the geometry of the constraint space.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-182.html">theory-182</a></td>

The theory proposes that representations and operators form coupled dynamical systems where: (1) each representation type (natural language literature vs executable code) has intrinsic structural constraints that determine which operator designs can preserve executability while generating novelty; (2) operators must be specifically adapted to respect the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic properties of their target representation to maintain positions on the Pareto frontier of novelty and executability; (3) the co-adaptation process creates representation-specific 'navigability landscapes' where certain regions of the novelty-executability space are accessible only through properly matched operator-representation pairs; (4) mismatched pairs lead to systematic biases toward either the novelty axis (producing creative but non-executable outputs) or the executability axis (producing valid but derivative outputs); and (5) the degree of required co-adaptation scales with the structural complexity and constraint density of the representation.

The theory posits that executability is not binary but exists on a spectrum determined by which constraint levels are violated. Critically, the theory introduces the concept of 'constraint-aware crossover points' - locations in the genome where crossover can occur with minimal constraint violation - and predicts that identifying and preferentially using these points will shift the novelty-executability frontier favorably. The theory applies to both code and literature, where constraints in literature include narrative coherence, thematic consistency, stylistic conventions, and logical flow.

Backward learning progress measures the rate at which goal-relevant skill gaps are being closed, capturing top-down goal-driven learning. The theory proposes that curriculum priority P(T) for task T should be computed as P(T) = α(t)·FLP(T) + (1-α(t))·BLP(T), where α(t) is a dynamic reweighting parameter that shifts based on learning phase, goal proximity, and progress stagnation. The reweighting function α(t) should increase (favoring forward progress) when: (1) the agent is far from goal competence, (2) forward progress is high and backward progress is low, or (3) goal tasks are too difficult to provide meaningful learning signal. Conversely, α(t) should decrease (favoring backward progress) when: (1) the agent approaches goal competence, (2) forward progress stagnates while goals remain unachieved, or (3) clear skill gaps for goal achievement are identified.

The theory proposes that commonsense knowledge serves as a semantic scaffold that enables agents to: interpret ambiguous instructions by filling in unstated assumptions, infer constraints from context, reason about the applicability of procedures across situations, and understand causal relationships between actions and effects. The necessity of commonsense augmentation increases with: (a) the degree of implicit knowledge assumed in task descriptions, (b) the diversity of contexts in which procedures must be applied, (c) the complexity of compositional reasoning required, and (d) the sparsity of domain-specific training examples.

The theory posits that scientific reasoning about heat transfer relies on understanding relative material behaviors and dimensionless parameter regimes (Biot number, Fourier number) rather than precise property values. A minimal simulator can represent materials using discrete property classes when: (1) the classification preserves ordering relationships and dimensionless group values within acceptable bounds (typically within 2-3x), (2) class boundaries are separated sufficiently to represent qualitatively different thermal behaviors, (3) the number of classes scales with the logarithm of the property range in the target domain (approximately N_classes ≈ 1 + log₂(k_max/k_min) for thermal conductivity), and (4) the discretization aligns with natural behavioral regimes (e.g., Biot << 1 for lumped capacitance, Biot >> 1 for distributed systems). This enables transfer across materials within the same dimensionless regime and to new materials if they fall within existing class boundaries.

The theory proposes that automated systems can be evaluated based on their ability to: (1) map their operational constraint space through explicit representation of assumptions and limitations, (2) detect proximity to constraint boundaries through computational and epistemic signatures, (3) distinguish between constraint-preserving (incremental) and constraint-modifying (transformational) discoveries through meta-level analysis, and (4) apply appropriate validation strategies based on constraint-space positioning. The validation requirements differ fundamentally: incremental discoveries require consistency checks within the existing constraint framework, while transformational discoveries require meta-level validation that the constraint modification itself is justified, productive, and leads to reproducible results in the modified space.

Each level requires progressively more rigorous validation criteria, greater human expert involvement, broader cross-domain verification, and longer temporal validation periods. The theory further asserts that automated systems must be capable of self-classifying their discoveries into these hierarchical levels and triggering appropriate validation protocols, as misclassification of discovery type leads to either excessive resource expenditure (over-validation) or premature acceptance of invalid findings (under-validation).

The theory predicts that optimal performance requires a hybrid approach where LM priors provide initial hypothesis space constraints and exploration strategies, which are then refined through a Bayesian-like updating process as environment-specific data accumulates. Critically, the agent must maintain uncertainty estimates over both the LM's knowledge quality and the environment's true dynamics, adjusting the relative weighting through an adaptive trust mechanism that responds to prediction errors and consistency checks.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-139.html">theory-139</a></td>

Rather than directly predicting future states (which becomes increasingly uncertain over long horizons), the model starts with noise and progressively refines it into plausible future trajectories. This approach naturally handles the multimodal nature of long-horizon predictions, where multiple plausible futures exist, and allows for controllable trade-offs between computational cost (number of denoising steps) and prediction fidelity. The theory posits that the diffusion process's inherent structure mirrors the epistemic uncertainty that grows with prediction horizon, making it fundamentally better suited than autoregressive or single-step predictors for long-horizon scenarios. The iterative refinement allows the model to maintain temporal coherence while exploring the space of plausible futures, and the conditioning mechanism enables action-aware predictions essential for planning and control.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-154.html">theory-154</a></td>

This structured decomposition enables more efficient learning, better generalization, improved sample efficiency, and enhanced interpretability compared to unstructured latent representations. The structure should incorporate physical inductive biases (conservation laws, symmetries, constraints) and align the latent space geometry with the action space to facilitate control.

The advantages stem from three primary mechanisms: (1) architectural alignment - transformers' attention mechanisms and positional encodings were designed for discrete sequences and operate more naturally over finite vocabularies; (2) learned compression through vector quantization that captures meaningful state abstractions while acting as a regularizing bottleneck; and (3) enhanced compositional generalization through discrete symbolic manipulation that enables recombination of learned primitives. Discrete tokens create a finite vocabulary of world states that transformers can efficiently attend over, enabling better long-range dependency modeling, more interpretable latent representations, and improved sample efficiency in learning world dynamics. The theory suggests that the discrete bottleneck acts as a beneficial inductive bias that forces the model to learn semantically meaningful abstractions rather than memorizing continuous trajectories. However, this advantage is modulated by task characteristics, with the greatest benefits occurring in domains with naturally compositional structure or where abstraction is beneficial, and potential disadvantages in domains requiring fine-grained continuous precision.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-152.html">theory-152</a></td>

The theory posits that optimal navigation policies naturally decompose into two levels: (1) a high-level policy that navigates between landmarks, and (2) local policies that navigate within landmark-defined regions. Landmarks emerge from graph topology: nodes with high betweenness centrality (lying on many shortest paths), nodes adjacent to door constraints (controlling access to regions), and nodes at the boundaries of high-clustering communities. The theory predicts that: (a) learning efficiency scales with the number of landmarks rather than total nodes (reducing sample complexity from O(N²) to O(L²) where L << N is the number of landmarks), (b) the optimal number of landmarks L* is approximately sqrt(N) × (D/D_max) where D is graph diameter and D_max is maximum possible diameter for N nodes, (c) policies structured around landmarks are more robust to local topology changes that don't affect landmark connectivity, and (d) transfer learning between graphs is effective when landmark structures are preserved even if local topology differs.

Different graph topologies impose different memory representation requirements: high-diameter graphs require efficient encoding of long-range connectivity patterns, high-clustering graphs benefit from hierarchical or modular representations, and constraint-heavy graphs (with doors, keys, etc.) require explicit state-dependency encoding. The efficiency of memory representation directly determines exploration efficiency by affecting: (1) the ability to avoid redundant exploration, (2) the speed of planning optimal paths, and (3) the capacity to generalize navigation strategies across similar substructures. Critically, the theory distinguishes between storage costs (memory capacity required) and retrieval costs (computational time to access relevant information), proposing that for large-scale navigation problems, retrieval efficiency becomes the dominant factor.

A Voronoi intersection in a navigation graph is a node from which multiple distinct regions can be reached with approximately equal cost, creating a natural 'hub' in the accessibility structure. The theory predicts that: (1) policies learned with explicit representation of Voronoi intersections converge faster than policies without such representation, (2) the value function gradient magnitude is maximized at Voronoi intersections, making them optimal locations for option/skill termination, (3) exploration strategies that prioritize discovering Voronoi intersections achieve better coverage with fewer samples, (4) the optimal policy structure naturally factorizes around Voronoi intersections, with distinct sub-policies for each accessible region, and (5) when door constraints or other conditional access mechanisms are present, their impact on navigation complexity is amplified proportionally to their proximity to Voronoi intersections. This superiority arises because Voronoi intersections represent maximal information gain points - decisions made at these locations have the highest impact on expected future trajectory and reward.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-144.html">theory-144</a></td>

High-degree nodes provide broad exploration potential and reduce expected path length in random walks, but may lead away from the goal semantically. High-similarity nodes provide goal-directed progress but may lead to dead-ends or require backtracking if they are low-degree. Optimal navigation policies must dynamically balance this trade-off based on: (1) exploration phase (early exploration favors degree, late exploitation favors similarity), (2) local graph topology (clustering coefficient and local density), (3) distance to goal (far from goal favors degree for rapid space coverage, near goal favors similarity for precision), and (4) door constraints and dead-end density (which penalize similarity-only strategies that may trap agents). The trade-off is most pronounced in graphs with heterogeneous degree distributions and non-uniform similarity structures, where degree and similarity are weakly correlated or anti-correlated.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-143.html">theory-143</a></td>

Specifically, the theory posits that: (1) experiments at higher abstraction levels provide constraints that prune the search space at lower levels, (2) the optimal allocation of experimental budget across decomposition levels follows a logarithmic relationship with respect to the size of each level's search space, weighted by the information propagation factor between levels, (3) agents should dynamically adjust their exploration strategy based on cross-level consistency checks, backtracking to higher levels when lower-level findings violate higher-level assumptions, and (4) the decomposition structure itself can be refined through meta-experiments that test the validity of the decomposition. The theory predicts that this structured approach achieves experimental efficiency that scales as O(sum_i k_i * log(n_i) * p_i) where k_i is the cost per experiment at level i, n_i is the search space size at level i, and p_i is the information propagation efficiency between levels.

The theory proposes that finite neural/computational resources must be allocated between building deep, specialized representations for complex environments versus maintaining broad, flexible representations for varied environments. This trade-off is not merely about sample efficiency or training time, but reflects fundamental architectural constraints in how embodied systems encode and retrieve sensorimotor knowledge. The theory predicts that systems optimized for high complexity will show brittleness to variation, while systems optimized for high variation will show performance ceilings in complex environments, with the product of achievable complexity and variation being bounded by system capacity. The severity of this trade-off is modulated by environmental structure (particularly compositionality), architectural choices (modularity, memory systems), and embodiment constraints.

The core premise is that different independence tests have varying reliability depending on the data characteristics, sample size, presence of confounders, and the complexity of conditioning sets. By dynamically calibrating significance thresholds based on the local structure of the search space and weighting test results by their estimated reliability, the algorithm can systematically downweight spurious signals while preserving true causal relationships. The theory integrates four key mechanisms: (1) context-dependent threshold calibration that adjusts α-levels based on the number of conditioning sets tested, local graph density, and the statistical power available given sample size; (2) reliability-based weighting that assigns confidence scores to independence tests based on statistical power, effect size, conditioning set complexity, and test type characteristics; (3) evidence accumulation across multiple related tests to distinguish systematic patterns from noise through consistency checking; and (4) adaptive distractor identification that flags variables showing inconsistent independence patterns across structurally related tests. This approach enables the discovery algorithm to maintain high precision in the presence of many irrelevant variables while avoiding excessive false negatives, addressing a critical challenge in open-ended virtual laboratory environments where the ratio of distractor to causally-relevant variables may be very high.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-122.html">theory-122</a></td>

The theory operates in four stages: (1) Learn an initial factorized representation of system dynamics, decomposing the system into K independent factors F₁, F₂, ..., Fₖ; (2) Generate augmented samples by recombining factor states from different observed trajectories, creating synthetic experiences; (3) Validate each augmented sample using counterfactual consistency: measure whether the learned dynamics for each factor correctly predict outcomes when that factor's state is taken from the augmented sample while other factors are resampled from their marginals; (4) Assign quality scores Q(s_aug) = (1/K)Σᵢ Cᵢ(s_aug) where Cᵢ is the consistency score for factor i, and use only augmented samples with Q > τ_quality for training. This approach ensures that augmented data respects the true causal structure and filters out spurious combinations that would introduce distractor signals.

The framework distinguishes between epistemic uncertainty (reducible through information gathering) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness), enabling information-seeking behaviors and risk-aware planning. Planning algorithms operate over this probabilistic symbolic representation using expected utility maximization that accounts for both goal achievement and information gain, selecting actions that are robust to uncertainty about the true world state.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-115.html">theory-115</a></td>

When a curriculum generator adversarially selects environments to maximize learner difficulty or regret, it can enter a degenerative state characterized by 'complexity collapse' - a positive feedback loop where the generator exploits specific learner weaknesses by repeatedly generating minor variations of environments the learner consistently fails. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: the learner cannot improve on this narrow distribution, maintaining high regret/difficulty, which further reinforces the curriculum's focus on this region. The degeneracy manifests as extreme reduction in environment variation (approaching zero entropy in the environment distribution) while complexity remains high or increases. Unlike healthy adversarial curricula that promote broad skill development through diverse challenges, degenerate curricula become stuck exploiting rather than teaching. This represents a fundamental trade-off failure where the system sacrifices variation for complexity in a pathological way.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-131.html">theory-131</a></td>

Specifically, the theory proposes that as environment complexity increases (more intricate state spaces, longer-horizon dependencies, richer dynamics), learning systems must develop increasingly structured, hierarchical representations to achieve sample-efficient learning. However, these structured representations come at a cost: they reduce the system's ability to generalize across environmental variations by creating specialized, brittle feature detectors and decision pathways. Conversely, learning systems exposed to high environmental variation must develop more flexible, distributed representations that sacrifice depth of structural encoding for breadth of generalization. The theory suggests there exists an optimal representational structure for any given complexity-variation profile, determined by the system's representational capacity and the statistical properties of the environment distribution. Mismatches between environmental demands and representational architecture lead to catastrophic failures in either sample efficiency (under-structured for complexity) or generalization (over-structured for variation). The scaling relationship is non-linear: small increases in complexity demand disproportionately more structure, while small increases in variation demand disproportionately more flexibility, creating a sharp trade-off boundary. This trade-off is fundamental when representational capacity is constrained, but may be partially overcome with sufficient capacity or architectural innovations that enable dynamic representational allocation.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-129.html">theory-129</a></td>

The theory suggests that the optimal sensor modality configuration depends on the specific position along the complexity-variation spectrum: high-complexity, low-variation environments favor high-dimensional sensors, while high-variation environments favor either low-dimensional sensors or high-dimensional sensors with strong inductive biases that compress information into task-relevant low-dimensional manifolds.

When learners condition on (observe or control for) a collider variable—one that is causally influenced by multiple manipulated variables—spurious correlations emerge among those causes. The theory introduces a propensity score framework where each variable's 'collider propensity' is computed based on: (1) the number of causal parents it has, (2) the frequency with which it is conditioned upon during inquiry, and (3) the strength of causal relationships from potential causes. Variables with high collider propensity are flagged, and correlations involving their parents are downweighted by a factor inversely proportional to the collider propensity score. Specifically, when a variable V has n causal parents and is conditioned upon with frequency f, its collider propensity P(V) = f × C(n,2) × mean(|β_i|), where β_i are the standardized path coefficients from parents to V. Correlations between any two parents of V are then adjusted by dividing the observed correlation by (1 + P(V)), effectively reducing the weight given to spurious signals. This approach is particularly valuable in open-ended virtual labs where learners freely choose which variables to observe and manipulate, making traditional causal discovery methods that assume no selection bias inadequate.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-123.html">theory-123</a></td>

The theory posits that text observations from the environment are inherently partial and ambiguous, requiring the agent to maintain uncertainty about the true underlying symbolic state. LLMs serve dual roles: (1) as observation models that map text observations to distributions over symbolic states, and (2) as generative models that predict how actions affect symbolic states and what observations will result. Planning involves searching for action sequences that maximize expected reward while accounting for both state uncertainty and observation uncertainty. Critically, the theory argues that belief states should be represented as distributions over complete symbolic state configurations, where each configuration specifies truth values for all relevant predicates. Actions update beliefs through a predict-update cycle: prediction propagates beliefs forward through action effects, and update incorporates new observations using Bayesian inference.

Features with low consistency scores are flagged as potentially spurious.

Specifically, successful interactive tool use requires at least five core competencies: (1) Goal Decomposition & Planning - breaking high-level goals into executable sub-goals, (2) Tool Selection - choosing appropriate tools for each sub-goal, (3) Parameter Binding - correctly mapping task variables to tool parameters, (4) State Monitoring - tracking environmental state and action outcomes, and (5) Error Recovery - detecting and correcting failures. QA tasks primarily require only comprehension and retrieval competencies, which are well-trained during pre-training and instruction tuning. In contrast, interactive tasks require all five competencies to execute in coordination, with outputs from one competency serving as inputs to others (e.g., state monitoring informs planning, planning guides tool selection). The theory posits that current LLM training provides implicit exposure to individual competencies but lacks explicit training on competency coordination and inter-competency dependencies. This creates three failure modes: (1) Competency Isolation - individual competencies may function well in isolation but fail when integrated, (2) Cascade Failures - errors in one competency propagate to dependent competencies, and (3) Coordination Overhead - the cognitive load of managing multiple competencies simultaneously exceeds model capacity. The theory predicts that interventions targeting competency coordination (e.g., modular architectures with explicit competency modules, training curricula that progressively increase coordination requirements, or prompting strategies that externalize coordination) will show larger improvements on interactive tasks than interventions targeting individual competencies.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-109.html">theory-109</a></td>

The theory proposes that by repeatedly sampling, evaluating, and refining symbolic outputs based on consistency checks, uncertainty quantification, and feedback from environment interactions, LLMs can converge toward more accurate and stable symbolic world models suitable for planning. The refinement process operates through four primary mechanisms: (1) self-consistency checking across multiple samples to identify stable symbolic patterns, (2) uncertainty-weighted aggregation of symbolic predictions using semantic entropy or token probability distributions, (3) constraint satisfaction verification against domain rules and logical consistency requirements, and (4) feedback integration from planning failures or environment mismatches to correct erroneous symbolic components. The theory predicts that symbolic outputs will exhibit measurable improvements in accuracy, consistency, and planning utility across refinement iterations, with diminishing returns following a power-law or logarithmic curve. Critically, the theory proposes that uncertainty estimates serve as reliable indicators of which symbolic components require further refinement, enabling efficient allocation of computational resources. The refinement process can be viewed as a form of self-supervised learning where the LLM uses its own outputs and consistency signals to bootstrap improved symbolic representations without requiring explicit ground-truth labels for each refinement step.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-117.html">theory-117</a></td>

LLMs are pretrained on static text where causal relationships and their consequences are presented simultaneously within local context windows, not on interactive sequences where actions create new contexts that must be integrated with prior state. This creates a horizon mismatch: the model's effective reasoning horizon (single forward pass over available context) is shorter than the task's required action-consequence horizon (multiple steps of state evolution).

The theory argues that standard transformer architectures lack dedicated mechanisms for maintaining execution state across interaction steps, distinguishing between planned actions and observed outcomes, and adaptively revising plans based on execution feedback. This creates a 'feedback integration bottleneck' where agents can articulate correct procedures (declarative knowledge from training) but cannot dynamically adjust execution based on real-time feedback (procedural competence).

Specifically, LLMs are trained predominantly on static, context-complete text where all necessary information is present within a single context window, and where success is measured by single-step prediction accuracy. In contrast, interactive procedural tasks require: (1) temporal credit assignment across long action sequences, (2) state tracking and memory management across episodes, (3) recovery from compounding errors, (4) exploration-exploitation tradeoffs, and (5) learning from sparse, delayed rewards. The training distribution lacks sufficient examples of these interactive dynamics, leading to models that can retrieve and synthesize knowledge (QA) but cannot effectively deploy it in sequential decision-making contexts. This mismatch manifests at multiple levels: token-level (next-token prediction vs. action selection), episode-level (single passages vs. multi-step trajectories), and objective-level (likelihood maximization vs. task completion). The theory acknowledges that scale and certain training methods (like RLHF) may partially compensate for this mismatch by enabling implicit learning of interactive patterns, and that inference-time interventions can partially bridge the gap by better utilizing the model's latent capabilities.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-106.html">theory-106</a></td>

The bridge operates through three core mechanisms: (1) Probabilistic Symbol Grounding, where symbolic predicates are associated with confidence distributions from LLM outputs (including token probabilities, ensemble disagreement, and semantic consistency measures); (2) Uncertainty-Aware State Abstraction, where continuous uncertainty estimates guide the granularity of symbolic state representations through adaptive partitioning; and (3) Confidence-Weighted Planning, where symbolic planning operators are weighted by propagated uncertainty from the LLM, with explicit uncertainty accumulation through operator chains. The theory posits that this integration enables more robust planning by maintaining interpretability while accounting for epistemic uncertainty inherent in language-based world modeling.

This architectural uniformity creates a fundamental bottleneck: while the same mechanism can retrieve and articulate procedural knowledge (QA), it cannot simultaneously maintain goal states, track environmental changes, plan action sequences, detect errors, and execute recovery strategies - all of which are required for successful interactive procedural performance. The theory predicts that introducing architectural modularity - specialized sub-networks or modules for distinct cognitive functions - will close the performance gap by allowing different aspects of procedural execution to be handled by components optimized for those specific functions.

During training, LLMs are optimized to minimize loss through pattern matching and direct retrieval, which requires minimal inference-time computation (single forward pass). QA tasks align well with this training regime because they can be solved through pattern recognition and retrieval of memorized knowledge. However, procedural tasks require substantial inference-time computation including search over action spaces, multi-step planning, error detection and recovery, and dynamic replanning - computational processes that are not incentivized or optimized during standard training. The model's learned representations and computational circuits are optimized for low-inference-computation scenarios and lack the mechanisms for effective inference-time search, verification, and planning. This theory predicts that interventions that either (a) train models to allocate more computation at inference time, or (b) provide architectural support for inference-time computation (search, planning, verification) will disproportionately improve procedural task performance while having minimal effect on QA performance.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-108.html">theory-108</a></td>

LLMs are trained primarily on static text corpora where 'grounding' refers to linguistic co-reference and semantic coherence, not to maintaining correspondence between linguistic representations and evolving environmental states. In interactive settings, agents must continuously update their internal representations to reflect environmental changes, track causal dependencies across action sequences, and maintain bidirectional grounding between language and world state. The gap emerges because: (1) QA tasks provide all necessary context upfront and require single-step reasoning, while interactive tasks require iterative context construction through action-observation loops; (2) Training on static text does not teach models to distinguish between 'knowing about' procedures (declarative knowledge) and 'executing' procedures (procedural knowledge with grounding); (3) The temporal credit assignment problem in multi-step interactions is not addressed by next-token prediction objectives; (4) Interactive tasks require maintaining multiple simultaneous groundings (goal states, current states, action effects, preconditions) that must be dynamically updated, whereas QA requires only understanding the question context; and (5) The gap can be partially mitigated through inference-time interventions (prompting strategies) or training-time interventions (interactive trajectory fine-tuning), but complete closure requires architectural changes that separate world-state tracking from linguistic processing. The theory further distinguishes between four types of grounding deficits: perceptual grounding (mapping observations to state), causal grounding (understanding action effects), temporal grounding (maintaining state across time), and goal grounding (tracking progress toward objectives). The magnitude of the gap varies systematically with task properties: it is smaller in deterministic, fully-observable, short-horizon tasks and in domains with strong pre-training coverage or formal feedback structures (code, mathematics), and larger in stochastic, partially-observable, long-horizon tasks in novel domains with natural language feedback.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-105.html">theory-105</a></td>

The closed-loop aspect ensures that each tool execution provides feedback that guides subsequent tool selection and composition. The theory predicts that agents will develop compositional strategies that minimize the depth of tool hierarchies while maximizing information gain, and that belief-state updates from tool outputs will be integrated through Bayesian-like updating mechanisms that weight tool reliability and output consistency.

In hybrid systems, EFE naturally decomposes into two components that map onto the two reasoning modes: (1) Pragmatic value - computed by the imperative subsystem to achieve goals through procedural actions, and (2) Epistemic value - computed to reduce uncertainty in the declarative knowledge base through information-gathering actions. The theory posits that the declarative component maintains probabilistic beliefs over world states and generates predictions, while the imperative component selects actions that minimize EFE by balancing exploitation (achieving goals via pragmatic value) and exploration (reducing uncertainty via epistemic value). The coupling between subsystems occurs through a precision-weighted prediction error mechanism: declarative predictions generate expected observations, imperative actions produce actual observations, and the mismatch drives both belief updating in the declarative system and policy selection in the imperative system. This creates a dynamic equilibrium where the system naturally transitions between exploitation and exploration based on the relative precision of declarative beliefs. The theory predicts that hybrid systems will exhibit superior performance compared to pure systems because they can explicitly represent and minimize both pragmatic and epistemic uncertainty, leading to more efficient learning and goal achievement.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-87.html">theory-87</a></td>

The theory posits that effective planning requires agents to maintain a semantic belief state that is continuously updated through bidirectional translation of tool outputs, and that shortest-path planning is achieved by projecting actions onto semantically-relevant subspaces that reduce the effective branching factor. The translation process acts as a semantic compiler that maps abstract intentions to concrete tool invocations, while the projection process acts as a dynamic filter that constrains the planning search space based on belief-state relevance.

Stochastic elements pervade modern machine learning: random seeds, data shuffling, dropout, data augmentation, sampling procedures, stochastic gradient descent, Monte Carlo methods, and random train/test splits. Natural language descriptions typically acknowledge stochasticity at a high level ('trained with dropout', 'data randomly shuffled', 'sampled from the posterior') while omitting critical implementation details: (1) whether and how random seeds are set for reproducibility, (2) the specific random number generator used, (3) the order in which stochastic operations are applied, (4) how stochasticity interacts across different components, (5) whether stochastic elements are fixed or vary across runs, and (6) how results are aggregated across stochastic runs. Code implementations must make all these choices explicit, creating a gap where many different implementations with substantially different behaviors could all claim to faithfully implement the same natural language description. This gap is particularly problematic because stochastic choices often have cascading effects throughout an experiment, and small differences in stochastic specification can lead to large differences in outcomes.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-94.html">theory-94</a></td>

When experimental descriptions exceed the effective context window size, critical information about dependencies, constraints, and relationships between experimental components becomes fragmented or lost, leading to predictable patterns of implementation errors. The theory distinguishes between two related but distinct mechanisms: (1) Human working memory limitations (approximately 4-7 chunks of information) that affect manual implementation, and (2) LLM attention and processing limitations that affect automated code generation, where effective context utilization degrades even when nominal context windows are large. The theory suggests that faithfulness degradation follows specific patterns based on: (a) the position of information relative to context boundaries (with middle positions most vulnerable), (b) the density and distance of cross-references in the description, (c) the complexity of dependency chains that must be maintained simultaneously, and (d) recency and primacy effects in information processing. Critically, the theory predicts that even with very large nominal context windows (100K+ tokens), effective utilization degrades substantially, creating a gap between theoretical capacity and practical performance.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-96.html">theory-96</a></td>

The theory posits that this mismatch occurs because: (1) authors assume readers understand implicit provenance conventions in their field, (2) complete provenance information is too verbose for natural language exposition, (3) provenance details are often determined during implementation rather than design, and (4) authors may not fully track or understand the provenance chains in their own code. This gap creates reproducibility failures when researchers cannot determine which exact data was used, in what state, with what transformations applied in what order.

Tool outputs are semantically analyzed to determine which specificity level(s) they inform, and belief-state updates integrate this information by: (a) matching tool outputs against existing commonsense knowledge at each level to detect confirmations or violations, (b) propagating implications bidirectionally (specific observations can invalidate general assumptions; general principles can constrain specific interpretations), and (c) using specificity-appropriate reasoning strategies (deductive for universal, abductive for domain-specific, inductive for instance-specific).

Specifically, datasets with different intrinsic properties (such as semantic entropy, task complexity, answer space size, and linguistic diversity) respond differently to the same hyperparameter settings, creating dataset-specific 'robustness profiles.' The mechanistic basis for this interaction lies in how sampling hyperparameters interact with the model's probability distribution over tokens, which itself is shaped by the dataset's semantic and statistical properties. When a dataset induces flatter probability distributions (higher entropy), sampling hyperparameters have more 'room' to affect which tokens are selected, leading to greater variability. Conversely, datasets that induce sharper distributions (lower entropy) are more robust to hyperparameter changes. This interaction effect means that hyperparameter configurations that produce stable, reproducible outputs on one dataset may produce highly variable outputs on another, even when using the same model and similar task structures. The theory suggests that optimal hyperparameter settings for reproducibility must be calibrated to the specific statistical and semantic properties of each dataset, and that universal 'best practices' for hyperparameter selection may be insufficient for ensuring reproducibility across diverse scientific applications.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-82.html">theory-82</a></td>

These strategies exhibit a fundamental duality: verification is most effective when systematic errors dominate and individual outputs can be reliably assessed, while aggregation is most effective when stochastic variation dominates and correct answers appear with sufficient frequency. The optimal approach for any task lies on a continuum between pure verification (single high-quality sample with deep checking) and pure aggregation (many samples with voting/consensus), determined by the task's error characteristics. Specifically, the effectiveness ratio E_v/E_a (verification effectiveness over aggregation effectiveness) predicts the optimal strategy: when E_v/E_a >> 1, favor verification; when E_v/E_a << 1, favor aggregation; when E_v/E_a ≈ 1, hybrid approaches combining both strategies yield optimal results.

The theory posits that constraints act as variance regulators through multiple mechanisms: (1) reducing the effective sampling space at each generation step, (2) creating hierarchical dependencies that propagate through the output, and (3) establishing anchor points that stabilize generation. Different constraint types modulate variance through distinct mechanisms: structural constraints reduce syntactic variance, semantic constraints reduce conceptual variance, and procedural constraints reduce methodological variance. The theory predicts that variance modulation effectiveness follows a non-linear relationship with constraint specificity, with diminishing returns at high specificity levels, and that constraint interactions can produce emergent variance patterns not predictable from individual constraints alone.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-77.html">theory-77</a></td>

The distribution of outputs across these clusters provides a principled measure of model uncertainty: high concentration in a single cluster indicates low uncertainty and high confidence, while distribution across multiple clusters indicates high uncertainty.

The entropy of the cluster distribution H(C) = -Σ p(c_i) log p(c_i) provides a scalar uncertainty measure, where p(c_i) is the proportion of outputs in cluster i.

When transferring procedures between domains, practitioners must: (1) identify all constraints in the source domain through systematic documentation and boundary testing, (2) classify constraints as either 'hard' (fundamental to the procedure's mechanism and outcome) or 'soft' (historical, conventional, resource-based, or domain-specific), (3) map source domain constraints onto target domain constraints to identify conflicts, compatibilities, and emergent constraints unique to the target domain, and (4) selectively relax soft constraints while preserving hard constraints, or circumvent hard constraints through technological innovation. The theory predicts that transfer failures often result from either relaxing hard constraints (causing mechanism failure) or unnecessarily preserving soft constraints (causing suboptimal adaptation or complete transfer failure). Successful transfer requires accurate constraint classification, understanding of constraint interactions, and strategic relaxation or circumvention. The theory further posits that constraint classification difficulty scales with procedural tacitness and that some constraints may be context-dependent (hard in one domain, soft in another).<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-70.html">theory-70</a></td>

Transfer occurs when perceived benefits exceed adaptation costs by a sufficient margin (the 'transfer threshold'). The theory predicts that transfer patterns follow a bounded rationality optimization function where scientists satisfice rather than optimize, minimizing adaptation effort while achieving acceptable procedural utility. This leads to preferential transfer of procedures with high modularity, clear mechanistic rationale, low context-dependency, and strong social proof. The theory further proposes that this trade-off creates distinct transfer regimes: (1) direct transfer (minimal adaptation, high similarity contexts, B/C > 3), (2) adaptive transfer (moderate adaptation, moderate similarity, 1.5 < B/C < 3), (3) transformative transfer (substantial adaptation, low similarity, 1.2 < B/C < 1.5), and (4) reinvention (adaptation costs exceed transfer benefits, B/C < 1.2, leading to de novo development).

At intermediate levels, it represents spatial regions and containers (e.g., 'kitchen', 'drawer', 'table surface') that group objects and relations. At the highest level, it represents abstract spatial schemas and layouts (e.g., 'typical kitchen layout', 'standard room configuration'). During planning, the model dynamically navigates this hierarchy, using high-level schemas to guide search and constraint satisfaction, intermediate-level regions to organize object locations, and low-level relations to specify precise spatial configurations. This hierarchical organization enables efficient reasoning by allowing the model to operate at the appropriate level of abstraction for each planning subtask, and to propagate constraints bidirectionally through the hierarchy. The theory posits that this hierarchy emerges implicitly from statistical regularities in linguistic descriptions of spatial arrangements and embodied activities in the training data.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-65.html">theory-65</a></td>

The theory posits that spatial grounding emerges from learned correspondences between linguistic descriptions and spatial configurations, either through: (1) direct multimodal pretraining where language and vision are jointly trained, creating shared representational spaces, or (2) indirect alignment where pure language models learn spatial relationships from rich textual descriptions of visual scenes, spatial arrangements, and physical interactions that implicitly encode visual-spatial structure. The theory suggests that this alignment creates 'pseudo-spatial' representations in language models that mirror key properties of actual spatial representations—including relative positioning, spatial extent, containment relationships, and geometric constraints. During embodied planning, language models leverage these aligned representations to simulate spatial configurations and reason about feasible actions by projecting linguistic action descriptions onto this pseudo-spatial substrate. The strength and fidelity of spatial reasoning is proportional to the degree of multimodal alignment, with explicitly multimodal models showing stronger spatial grounding than pure language models, but both benefiting from the same underlying alignment mechanism.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-67.html">theory-67</a></td>

The theory posits that without direct sensory input, LMs learn these representations through statistical co-occurrence patterns in language that reflect physical constraints of the world, creating 'linguistic shadows' of embodied experience. These shadows preserve causal structure (action A must precede action B), spatial structure (object relations constrain possible configurations), and physical constraints (certain object-action combinations are linguistically rare because they are physically impossible). The representations are primarily qualitative and relational rather than metric, which explains both the successes (qualitative spatial reasoning, procedural ordering) and failures (precise metric reasoning, novel spatial configurations) of LMs on embodied tasks.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-62.html">theory-62</a></td>

Procedures can be represented as directed graphs where nodes represent operations/steps and edges represent dependencies, resource flows, and causal relationships. Transfer success is determined by constraint satisfaction: a procedure (or subgraph module) from a source domain can transfer to a target domain only if all constraints encoded in its graph structure can be satisfied in the target context. Constraints include: (1) Input availability constraints - all required input nodes must have satisfiable predecessors in the target graph, (2) Environmental compatibility constraints - node operations must be executable in the target domain's physical/technical environment, (3) Ordering constraints - temporal and causal dependencies encoded in edges must remain valid, (4) Resource constraints - material, equipment, and expertise requirements must be available, and (5) Semantic constraints - operations must retain their functional meaning in the new context. The theory predicts that transfer difficulty scales with the number and specificity of unsatisfied constraints, and that successful cross-domain transfer requires either: (a) high structural similarity between source and target domains (few constraint violations), (b) availability of 'adapter' subgraphs that resolve constraint mismatches, or (c) simplification/abstraction of the procedure to remove domain-specific constraints.

The core principle posits that transfer effectiveness depends primarily on preserving the causal mechanisms and constraint structures of the real domain, rather than matching surface features, statistical distributions, or observational fidelity. Specifically, a synthetic environment that accurately represents the causal dependencies between variables—even with simplified representations of the variables themselves—will enable better transfer of procedural knowledge than one that matches the statistical properties of observations but misrepresents causal relationships. This occurs because scientific procedures fundamentally involve interventions on systems, and interventions depend on causal structure rather than correlational patterns. The theory explains why domain randomization techniques in robotics can be effective despite reducing visual fidelity, why mechanistic models in biology often transfer better than purely data-driven models, and why simplified climate models that preserve key feedback mechanisms can provide insights that transfer better than more detailed models lacking certain causal pathways. The theory distinguishes between procedures involving causal interventions (where mechanism preservation is critical) and pattern recognition tasks (where statistical fidelity may suffice).<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-72.html">theory-72</a></td>

The position on this spectrum is determined by multiple factors including: (1) the frequency and format of arithmetic problems in training data, (2) the complexity and size of operands, (3) the model's scale and architecture, and (4) the specific arithmetic operation. Small, frequent problems (e.g., single-digit addition) are primarily solved through memorized lookup-like mechanisms encoded in early-to-middle layers, while larger problems require the model to compose multi-step computational procedures across deeper layers. Critically, this theory posits that models develop intermediate representations that blend both memorized 'arithmetic facts' and algorithmic steps, with the balance shifting based on problem characteristics. The theory further proposes that models learn multiple parallel pathways for arithmetic, with different circuits specializing in different ranges of the memorization-computation spectrum. These pathways can be selectively activated or suppressed through prompting strategies, and they compete or cooperate depending on problem characteristics. The theory also acknowledges that tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain which strategies are accessible, as they determine how numerical information is encoded and processed.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-56.html">theory-56</a></td>

Rather than learning a single, format-invariant arithmetic procedure, models develop format-specific computational strategies optimized for the particular representational structure they encounter. This includes tokenization boundaries (character-level vs. subword), digit separators (spaces, commas, none), notation systems (positional, scientific, verbal), and problem layout (horizontal equations vs. vertical alignment). Each format creates different computational affordances and constraints that shape which algorithmic approaches are learnable. For instance, character-level tokenization enables digit-by-digit algorithms similar to human grade-school methods, while subword tokenization may force chunk-based or magnitude-estimation strategies. Similarly, comma-separated numbers may trigger different parsing and grouping algorithms than unseparated digit strings. The theory predicts that models will show format-specific performance patterns, struggle with format transfer, and that their internal representations and attention patterns will reflect the algorithmic strategies induced by their training format. This explains why models trained on different formats show different error patterns, why format changes at test time degrade performance, and why certain formats enable better arithmetic learning than others.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-55.html">theory-55</a></td>

Each stage produces outputs that cascade forward as inputs to subsequent stages, creating dependencies where decisions at earlier stages constrain later possibilities. The cascade operates bidirectionally: forward cascades represent normal transfer progression, while backward cascades occur when failures trigger re-examination of earlier stages. The cascade structure means that errors or suboptimal decisions at any stage propagate through subsequent stages, and successful transfer often requires multiple forward-backward cascade cycles to refine transformations at all stages.

The theory posits that each experimental domain develops preferred representational formats optimized for its particular phenomena, instruments, and epistemic culture.

These proxy representations enable embodied planning by mapping linguistic patterns to latent spatial-relational structures that approximate the constraints and affordances of the physical world. The theory posits that this proxy grounding operates through distributional semantics, where co-occurrence patterns and syntactic structures in language serve as compressed encodings of physical world regularities. However, this mechanism introduces systematic biases toward frequently described, linguistically salient scenarios, and may fail to capture physical constraints that are rarely explicitly stated in text (such as implicit physical laws or edge cases).<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-63.html">theory-63</a></td>

The theory posits that active learning efficiency—measured as knowledge gain per query—is maximized when queries systematically probe three types of boundaries: (1) validity boundaries (where the procedure ceases to function), (2) optimality boundaries (where the procedure functions but suboptimally), and (3) safety boundaries (where the procedure becomes hazardous). The theory predicts that query strategies targeting boundary conditions yield 3-5x higher information gain per query compared to queries about nominal operating conditions, because boundary information simultaneously defines both what works and what doesn't, creating contrastive learning signals. Efficiency gains arise from three mechanisms: (a) boundary queries reduce the hypothesis space more rapidly by eliminating large regions of invalid procedures, (b) boundary knowledge enables better generalization by defining applicability constraints, and (c) boundary discovery prevents costly negative transfer by preemptively identifying domain differences. The theory uniquely predicts that 'boundary-aware' active learning—where query selection explicitly prioritizes boundary exploration—can reduce the total number of queries needed for successful transfer by 40-60% compared to random or uncertainty-based sampling alone.

When tokenization creates chunks that don't align with these digit positions - such as when multi-digit numbers are split into arbitrary subword units by BPE tokenization - the model must learn a more complex mapping between its token representations and the underlying arithmetic structure. Fine-grained tokenization (character-level or digit-level) creates a natural correspondence between tokens and the atomic units of arithmetic algorithms, reducing the complexity of the function the model must learn. Coarser tokenization (word-level, or BPE that creates multi-digit chunks) requires the model to implicitly decompose tokens into digits, track carries across token boundaries that don't align with digit boundaries, and recompose results - all within its internal representations. The theory predicts that arithmetic performance, sample efficiency, and length generalization will improve as tokenization granularity becomes finer and more aligned with digit-level structure, with the strongest effects for operations requiring precise positional alignment (like multi-digit addition and multiplication).<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Generation Method:</b> llm_baseline_no_evidence<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929<br><b>Original Theory ID:</b> <a href="theories/theory-58.html">theory-58</a></td>

Memory acts as both a filter (preventing wasteful re-exploration) and a guide (directing attention to promising unexplored regions). The efficiency gain is not merely from avoiding duplicate actions, but from building a meta-level understanding of which types of states and actions are likely to yield new information or progress. This creates a positive feedback loop where better memory organization leads to more efficient exploration, which in turn provides better training data for memory organization. The theory is most applicable to complex, large state-space games where systematic exploration provides advantages over random or simple heuristic-based approaches.

The theory distinguishes between four primary types of misalignment: (1) Systematic biases (position, length, style, verbosity) - best addressed by post-hoc calibration (e.g., position swapping, length control via GLM) or training-time augmentation (e.g., swap augmentation), achieving 8-15 percentage point improvements; (2) Domain knowledge gaps - best addressed by fine-tuning on domain-specific data (1K-10K examples for 80% of maximum improvement) or in-context learning with domain examples; (3) Rubric misunderstanding - best addressed by in-context learning with 3-5 examples (10-20 percentage point improvements) or explicit criteria repetition; (4) Reasoning errors - best addressed by chain-of-thought prompting (5-15 percentage point improvements), reference-guided evaluation, or modular agentic approaches. The theory predicts diminishing returns from multiple interventions: the first well-targeted intervention provides the largest improvement (typically 50-70% of achievable gains), the second complementary intervention provides 20-30%, and subsequent interventions provide progressively smaller gains (<10% each). Training-time interventions are 1.5-2x more effective than post-hoc calibration but 10-100x more expensive.

This alignment can occur through multiple mechanisms: (1) direct token mapping where language tokens represent discretized actions (e.g., RT-2's action tokenization), (2) hierarchical decomposition where high-level language actions are mapped to low-level motor primitives through learned or programmatic interfaces (e.g., IGOR's subtask decomposition, OPEx's skill library), (3) reward/goal specification where language defines objectives rather than actions (e.g., MineCLIP's reward function), or (4) code-as-policy where language models generate executable programs that invoke action primitives (e.g., Voyager). The degree of action-space mismatch—measured by semantic distance, temporal granularity, and structural compatibility—is a primary determinant of transfer difficulty. Larger mismatches require either more embodied data, sophisticated bridging mechanisms (e.g., inverse dynamics models, skill libraries), or indirect specification through goals. The effectiveness of different alignment strategies depends on task characteristics: discrete semantic tasks favor direct mapping, continuous control tasks require hierarchical decomposition or goal-based approaches, and long-horizon tasks benefit from compositional action representations.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Constraint-agnostic operators can explore more freely but waste evaluations on invalid offspring. The optimal approach depends on constraint complexity and evaluation cost: for expensive evaluation (e.g., hardware synthesis), constraint-preserving operators are essential; for cheap evaluation (e.g., expression evaluation), constraint-agnostic with rejection may be acceptable.

Bloat can protect functional building blocks from destructive crossover (increasing executability) and provide neutral variation space (maintaining diversity), but excessive bloat reduces interpretability and evaluation efficiency. Aggressive bloat control (e.g., strict parsimony pressure, frequent simplification) improves executability and efficiency but can reduce diversity by eliminating neutral variations and disrupt building blocks. The optimal balance depends on problem characteristics: deceptive problems benefit from bloat-enabled diversity, while problems with clear gradients benefit from lean, efficient code. Effective systems use adaptive bloat control (e.g., operator equalization, generation-wide simplification, size-fair crossover) that maintains sufficient diversity for exploration while preventing runaway growth. The relationship between bloat and these outcomes is representation-dependent, with tree-based representations showing stronger bloat effects than linear genomes.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Operators exist on a spectrum from purely syntactic (random tree edits) to deeply semantic (learned from domain data). Traditional hand-designed operators encode human intuitions about useful variations but are limited to syntactic or shallow semantic transformations. Learned operators—particularly those based on large pre-trained models (LLMs for code, generative models for other domains)—can access richer hypothesis spaces by leveraging statistical patterns learned from large corpora of human-generated solutions. These learned operators implicitly encode domain-specific heuristics (code idioms, common patterns, functional compositions, type constraints) that improve both novelty (by suggesting non-obvious but valid combinations) and executability (by respecting learned constraints and conventions). However, this comes with trade-offs: (1) bias toward training distribution patterns that may limit discovery of truly out-of-distribution solutions, (2) higher computational cost, and (3) reduced interpretability. The novelty-executability frontier is expanded when operators can draw from appropriate priors—whether learned from data, encoded through formal systems (grammars, type systems), or derived from domain knowledge. Hybrid approaches that combine learned operators (for informed exploration), formal constraints (for guaranteed validity), and traditional operators (for unbiased variation) can achieve better coverage of the novelty-executability frontier than any single approach.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Operators can be characterized by their 'semantic step size': the typical magnitude of behavioral change they produce in the solution's functional behavior. Small-step operators (e.g., point mutation, parameter perturbation, single-instruction insertion/deletion) maintain high executability by making local changes that preserve most program structure and semantics, but limit novelty to gradual exploration of nearby regions. Large-step operators (e.g., subtree crossover, module replacement, LLM-based generation) can produce high novelty by making distant jumps in semantic space, potentially discovering qualitatively different solutions, but risk generating non-executable offspring due to constraint violations, type errors, or semantic incoherence. The optimal operator scale is problem-dependent, representation-dependent, and often time-varying: early evolution benefits from large steps to explore diverse regions and escape poor initializations, while late evolution benefits from small steps to refine solutions and optimize parameters. The relationship between step size and executability is mediated by the problem's constraint structure, the representation's locality properties, and the selection pressure applied. Systems that adapt operator scale dynamically (e.g., adaptive mutation rates, temperature-controlled LLM sampling, time-varying crossover/mutation probabilities, multi-armed bandits over operator choices) or maintain multiple scales simultaneously (e.g., ensemble operators, hierarchical search with different scales at different levels) can better navigate the novelty-executability frontier across evolutionary stages and problem regions.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

This alignment can be achieved through three mechanisms: (1) explicit design where representations expose functional modularity (e.g., linear genomes with instruction-level semantics, typed expression trees, service-sequence compositions) enabling operators to recombine or mutate at semantically meaningful boundaries; (2) learned alignment where operators (e.g., LLM-based crossover) learn to respect representation patterns from data; or (3) semantic alignment where operators work directly in behavior/output space rather than genotype space. Misaligned operator-representation pairs (e.g., subtree crossover on highly epistatic structures, point mutation on representations with complex dependencies, univariate probabilistic models on interacting components) produce high rates of non-executable offspring or limit novelty to local perturbations. The novelty-executability frontier is shaped by four factors: (1) the granularity at which operators can manipulate the representation, (2) the degree to which representation boundaries correspond to functional modules, (3) the operator's ability to preserve or restore executability constraints (type safety, syntactic validity, semantic coherence) after variation, and (4) whether the operator-representation alignment is explicit, learned, or semantic.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The mechanism operates by reducing cognitive load and exploration noise: full knowledge graphs overwhelm agents with irrelevant relations (often 90%+ of provided knowledge is not immediately relevant), leading to noisy action selection and inefficient exploration. Incremental exposure focuses the agent's attention on currently relevant concepts, improving sample efficiency by 15-40% and reducing required training steps by 20-50% in tasks with large knowledge bases. However, this advantage diminishes or reverses in tasks requiring global planning or when the knowledge base is small (<100 relations), and in some simple task settings where ground-truth full belief graphs can outperform commonsense-based incremental approaches.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Critically, structured latents enable direct application of classical controllers (P/PID) without learning policies, reducing sample complexity by 10-100x and enabling one-shot or few-shot imitation learning.

The EDM (Elucidating Diffusion Models) formulation with network preconditioning provides superior stability for autoregressive rollouts compared to DDPM, enabling stable generation even with very few denoising steps (NFE=1-3). Key design principles: (1) use EDM preconditioning with adaptive training targets for stable score estimates at high noise levels, (2) limit denoising steps to NFE=3-5 for practical efficiency while maintaining quality (far fewer than the 1000 steps used in image generation), (3) condition on actions, rewards, and other control signals for controllability, (4) use latent diffusion rather than pixel diffusion for 10-100x computational efficiency, and (5) apply diffusion in offline settings or with sufficient computational budget. Diffusion models excel at capturing multi-modal distributions and preventing mode collapse, but require substantially more compute than deterministic models (10-100x) and may be unsuitable for real-time applications.

This is because reconstruction forces the model to encode all visual information including task-irrelevant details (as evidenced by DreamerV3 reconstructing background details at the expense of small task elements), while contrastive objectives allow the model to focus on temporally consistent, task-relevant features. The optimal reconstruction-free approach combines: (1) multi-step temporal contrastive losses (K=3-5 steps) rather than single-step to capture dynamics, (2) separate low-capacity linear dynamics for contrastive prediction to enforce temporal smoothness while avoiding extreme latent jumps, (3) data augmentation (random crops) to encourage invariance to irrelevant visual variations, and (4) careful tuning of KL balancing parameters to prevent posterior collapse. However, this approach involves trade-offs: reconstruction-free models may require higher computational costs (e.g., two-view encoding in DreamerPro), can have lower performance on clean tasks where reconstruction provides useful auxiliary supervision, and require careful hyperparameter tuning. The performance advantage is most pronounced in environments with substantial visual distractors (>30% of visual field) where reconstruction-based models waste capacity on nuisance features.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

However, hybrid approaches that combine structured components with learned components can achieve both interpretability and competitive performance. The optimal balance depends critically on the application domain: safety-critical systems (autonomous driving, robotics) should favor interpretability even at moderate performance cost due to debugging needs and failure detection, while pure performance tasks (games, benchmarks) can use black-box models. Interpretability can be achieved through multiple mechanisms: (1) structured latent spaces with semantic meaning (positions, velocities, causal variables), (2) modular architectures with explicit factorization, (3) discrete representations (tokens, codes) that are enumerable and inspectable, (4) auxiliary decoders that visualize internal states, (5) attention mechanisms that reveal information flow, and (6) explicit uncertainty quantification. Critically, interpretability aids in debugging (3-5x faster failure mode identification), enables safety verification, and can improve generalization, but may constrain model expressiveness and add computational overhead.

This pruning reduces the effective branching factor from exponential (template × vocabulary combinations) to linear (entities present in current context), enabling tractable exploration and faster convergence. The effectiveness of pruning depends critically on: (1) the accuracy of knowledge graph construction from noisy text, (2) the availability of valid-action supervision or other guidance signals during training, and (3) the ratio of vocabulary size to typical number of relevant entities per state.

The optimal balance shifts systematically as a function of path position: early in the path, degree should be weighted heavily to 'escape' the local neighborhood and reach well-connected regions of the network; late in the path, similarity should dominate to 'home in' on the specific target. This creates a position-dependent weighting function where degree weight decreases and similarity weight increases along the path.

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Prior Knowledge Integration via Language Models Theory<br><b>Description:</b> Large language models can provide effective prior knowledge for exploration in reinforcement learning by generating reward shifts or guidance that bias the agent toward behaviors consistent with human knowledge, even in domains where the LLM has no direct experience. The mechanism works by having the LLM evaluate state-action pairs (or states) and return reward shifts (typically +1/0/-1 or finer gradations) that are added to environment rewards. These shifts are mathematically equivalent to initializing Q-values optimistically or pessimistically, thereby altering the agent's action-selection probabilities during training. The LLM's evaluation can use various prompting strategies (Chain-of-Thought, Zero-shot) and can handle multimodal inputs through vision-language pipelines (e.g., LLaVA → Vicuna). This approach is particularly effective in sparse-reward environments where random exploration would be prohibitively slow, as it provides an implicit curriculum that focuses exploration on promising regions while avoiding known-bad regions. The effectiveness depends critically on: (1) the quality and size of the LLM (smaller/poorly quantized models underperform), (2) the prompt design and alignment with the task, (3) the LLM's ability to process the input modality (text works better than images), and (4) the correctness of the LLM's prior knowledge for the domain. The approach is flexible and can be integrated with various RL algorithms (TD, MC, DQN, PPO, A2C, SAC, TD3, R2D2, SlateQ) and combined with other exploration methods like intrinsic motivation.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Agents that identify and leverage structure can aggregate information across equivalent states, focus exploration on representative subspaces, decompose complex exploration problems into simpler subproblems, or use causal reasoning to avoid self-reinforcing failures. The key mechanisms are: (1) symmetry exploitation reduces the effective state space by aggregating data across equivalent states (sample complexity scales with compression factor Φ), (2) submodular structure enables greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees (e.g., 1-1/e for monotone submodular maximization), (3) hierarchical decomposition enables temporal abstraction and credit assignment across multiple timescales, (4) homomorphisms enable planning in abstract spaces with provable regret bounds, (5) causal structure (treating actions as interventions) prevents self-reinforcing belief failures, and (6) learned latent structure (e.g., VAE goal spaces) can provide similar benefits when learned accurately. The effectiveness of structured exploration increases with the degree of structure present and the accuracy of the structural assumptions, but is limited by the computational cost of identifying and exploiting structure.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Unlike prediction error (which conflates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty), ensemble disagreement naturally converges to low values on inherently stochastic transitions (where all models learn the same predictive distribution) while remaining high on under-explored transitions (where models have learned different hypotheses). This makes ensemble disagreement superior to prediction error for exploration in stochastic environments. The key mechanism is that bootstrap sampling or diverse initialization creates models that explore different hypotheses early in learning, and their disagreement indicates regions where more data would reduce model uncertainty. The effectiveness depends on maintaining ensemble diversity through bootstrap resampling, different initializations, or different architectures, and scales with ensemble size up to a point of diminishing returns.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Agents that balance expected information gain or reward improvement against query costs achieve substantially better performance under resource constraints than agents that ignore costs. The key mechanism is a dynamic resource allocation strategy that automatically exploits cheap approximate information sources early in learning (when uncertainty is high and any information is valuable) and switches to expensive accurate sources only when needed to refine estimates near optimal solutions. This creates a natural curriculum from cheap exploration to expensive exploitation. The benefit of cost-aware methods scales with the ratio of expensive-to-cheap source costs and depends on the correlation structure between sources. Cost-aware methods enable principled decisions about evaluation fidelity, sample size, and stopping criteria by explicitly trading off information gain against resource expenditure through mechanisms such as cost-benefit ratios, joint optimization of design and cost parameters, or mathematical programming over resource allocations.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Agents that commit to a sampled hypothesis, policy, or value function for an entire episode (or extended period) achieve 'deep exploration' that can discover distant rewards and resolve long-horizon uncertainties. The key mechanism is that temporal commitment creates temporally-extended behavior patterns that: (1) allow exploratory actions to propagate backward through value estimates via TD learning, (2) enable the agent to follow through on multi-step plans that reach informative states far from the initial state, and (3) implement effective posterior sampling in sequential settings by maintaining consistency with a sampled hypothesis. In contrast, per-step randomization (e.g., epsilon-greedy) produces diffusive, uncoordinated exploration that fails to discover rewards requiring coordinated action sequences. The benefit of temporal commitment scales with the depth of exploration required and is most pronounced in deterministic or low-noise environments where multi-step plans can be reliably executed.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The effectiveness of DR follows a complexity-variation trade-off: uniform domain randomization over all parameters is sample-inefficient and can prevent learning by creating too much variation, while targeted randomization enables learning by focusing on informative parameter regions. Active domain randomization (ADR) that learns to prioritize informative parameter regions improves sample efficiency and transfer quality, with benefits increasing as the dimensionality of the randomization space grows. However, ADR with learned discriminator rewards can be exploited to create impossible environments. The optimal DR strategy balances coverage of the reality gap with learnability, and should be guided by either: (a) prior knowledge of sim-real differences, (b) adaptive sampling based on learning progress, or (c) self-supervised signals that avoid exploitability. The effectiveness of DR also depends on task characteristics: simple tasks with accurate simulation may not require DR, while complex contact-rich tasks benefit most from targeted randomization.

This degeneracy manifests in several forms: (1) Minimax collapse: unconstrained adversaries drive student performance to zero by generating impossible tasks; (2) Exploration failure: in high-dimensional or permutation-invariant spaces, adversaries fail to discover informative task regions; (3) Curriculum drift: adversaries optimize for short-term difficulty rather than long-term learning progress; (4) Exploitability: learned reward functions can be gamed to produce degenerate environments. Degeneracy is particularly severe when: (a) the adversary is unconstrained (pure minimax), (b) the task space is high-dimensional, continuous, or has combinatorial structure, (c) the adversary learns faster than the student can adapt, (d) there is no mechanism to ensure task solvability or relevance. Mitigation strategies include: regret-based constraints (PAIRED) that ensure tasks remain solvable by an antagonist, replay-based curation (PLR, REPAIRED) that maintains a buffer of useful tasks, self-supervised reward signals (asymmetric self-play) that avoid learned discriminator exploitation, and learned task manifolds (CLUTR) that structure the task space. However, even mitigated methods can struggle: PAIRED adapts slowly and can degenerate in permutation-invariant spaces; pure replay without generation may not discover sufficiently challenging tasks. The fundamental trade-off is between adversarial adaptivity (which can find hard tasks) and stability (which prevents degeneracy).<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Depth sensors provide geometric information that is invariant to appearance variation (texture, color, lighting), enabling better generalization across visually diverse environments than RGB sensors at equivalent training scales. RGB sensors can achieve comparable generalization but require substantially larger and more diverse training sets because they must learn to extract geometric structure while ignoring appearance variation. The benefit of depth over RGB increases with: (1) the amount of visual variation in the environment, (2) the complexity of the navigation task, and (3) constraints on training data availability. However, RGB sensors are necessary for tasks requiring appearance-based reasoning (e.g., identifying objects by color or texture). The depth advantage is robust to moderate sensor noise but can be compromised by extreme noise or failure modes specific to depth sensors (transparent/reflective surfaces). At very large training scales (billions of frames across thousands of diverse environments), RGB agents can approach depth-level generalization, but at 10-100x higher data requirements.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Adaptive curricula that coordinate both dimensions can sometimes increase them simultaneously by maintaining intermediate difficulty.

Valid augmentation requires: (1) learning or knowing the local causal graph structure (which components influence which next-state components), (2) identifying independent components in the local graph that can be safely swapped between transitions, and (3) validating proposed counterfactuals by verifying that the local causal structure remains consistent after swapping. The validation step is critical: proposals are accepted only if recomputing the local mask on the counterfactual yields the same graph partitioning as the original, and if structural equations for swapped components are identical across source neighborhoods. When properly validated, counterfactual augmentation can increase effective dataset size by n^m (n factual samples, m independent components) with minimal model bias compared to model-based augmentation. However, the approach requires accurate local causal structure estimation, which can fail in high-dimensional observation spaces or when using naive attention-based methods.

The fundamental insight is that the inverse principal submatrix A^{-1}_{S,S} of the mixing matrix is an ISA solution, where observed variables sharing latent parents form irreducible multi-dimensional subspaces while unconfounded variables form 1-D independent components. By constructing surrogate variables that null cross-covariance with other observed sets (ω^T Y where ω^T E[YZ^T] = 0) and testing their independence using nonparametric tests (HSIC), one can: (1) identify which observed variables share latent causes, (2) determine the dimensionality of latent confounders behind each group (Dim(L(P)) = Dim(P) - 1), (3) recover causal ordering among latent variables through recursive GIN testing, and (4) eliminate spurious edge assignments via admissible permutation filtering based on block-rank criteria.

The spurious correlation can be eliminated by backdoor adjustment: estimating propensity scores P(C|S) and reweighting samples by these propensities to simulate do(C). This approach is more appropriate than adjusting for other covariates and can be implemented as a plug-in regularizer for existing OOD methods. The effectiveness depends critically on accurate propensity estimation, and various variance-reduction techniques (clipping, self-normalization, doubly robust estimation) can improve practical performance.

The theory predicts that proper test calibration combined with conflict resolution can reduce false discovery rates by 50-80% compared to naive threshold-based approaches, with the exact improvement depending on graph density, sample size, and the presence of latent confounders or missing data.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Effective feedback mechanisms include: (1) syntax errors from parsers/validators/compilers, (2) semantic errors from execution/simulation/plan validation, (3) type and constraint violations, and (4) timeout/resource limit violations. The effectiveness of iterative refinement depends critically on: (a) translating formal error messages into natural language that LLMs can understand, (b) the base capability of the LLM (GPT-4 substantially outperforms GPT-3.5), (c) maintaining cumulative context across iterations (e.g., helper functions, previous corrections), and (d) the complexity and structure of the target formalism. Systems with automated debugging loops achieve substantially higher success rates (often 80-95%) compared to single-shot generation (often <50%). However, iterative refinement has limitations: LLMs can get stuck in loops, repeat the same mistakes, or fail to converge even with feedback, particularly when the task requires capabilities beyond the LLM's base competence.

This approach is most effective for domains requiring commonsense knowledge, spatial reasoning, or semantic understanding where formal symbolic models are unavailable or incomplete. However, LLMs as world models have critical limitations: they are unreliable for deterministic single-step state prediction (achieving only ~68-70% accuracy), require structured search to overcome prediction errors, and need additional scaffolding (grammar constraints, code execution, or iterative correction) for reliable operation. The key insight is that LLMs provide useful probabilistic priors and transition distributions when properly sampled and integrated into planning, but should not be used for direct deterministic simulation.

The graph representation provides a structured substrate for planning that handles spatial connectivity, while learned components (value functions, neural scorers, or LLM reasoning) handle partial observability, uncertain state estimation, and action selection under ambiguity. The benefit of this hybrid approach is most pronounced in environments with: (1) non-trivial spatial structure (multiple rooms, complex connectivity), (2) long-horizon navigation requirements, and (3) partial observability where classical heuristics (e.g., Euclidean distance) are unavailable or unreliable. However, the effectiveness critically depends on accurate graph construction, which in text-only environments must be inferred from descriptions.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The cumulative effect of these layer-wise gaps compounds to create discrepancies between described intent and actual behavior.

The mechanism operates through a chain: spectral norm constraints reduce the Lipschitz constant of learned functions, which enables approximation by lower-degree polynomials, corresponding to lower Kolmogorov complexity. This effect is particularly pronounced when applied jointly to both slow meta-learning components (e.g., instruction inference modules) and fast adaptation components (e.g., execution modules), leading to emergent separation where meta-learned representations become stable across tasks while execution adapts rapidly.

This dataset-specificity creates a reproducibility challenge: methods that perform well with tuned hyperparameters may perform poorly with fixed hyperparameters across datasets. The theory proposes that hyperparameter sensitivity (measured by ANP_best - ANP_fix) is a fundamental property of decoding methods, and that 'robust' methods are those with low sensitivity - they maintain performance across datasets without per-dataset tuning. The underlying mechanism is related to the entropy of the model's output distribution: aligned models have lower next-token entropy, which reduces the operating space for hyperparameter variation and thus reduces sensitivity. The theory predicts that hyperparameter sensitivity correlates with both the model's output entropy and the dataset's optimal output distribution characteristics.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The theory posits that Pass@k metrics capture the model's latent capability that is obscured by single-sample stochasticity, and that the gap between Pass@1 and Pass@k quantifies the 'stochastic correctness gap' - the capability lost to sampling randomness. This gap can be closed through three primary mechanisms: (a) increasing sample size k and using verification (exploration-verification), (b) training to increase single-sample reliability (e.g., via SFT scaling, alignment, or data resampling), or (c) using ranking heuristics to select the best sample without verification (proxy-verification). The theory predicts that verification-aggregation is most effective when the model has high latent capability (high Pass@k) but low single-sample reliability (low Pass@1), and that the optimal strategy depends on the relative costs of generation, verification, and training, as well as task characteristics (deterministic vs open-ended).<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

By clustering sampled outputs into semantic equivalence classes (via bidirectional entailment using NLI models) and computing entropy over these clusters rather than individual sequences, we obtain a more robust uncertainty estimate that is invariant to paraphrasing and surface-form variation. This 'semantic entropy' better predicts model correctness than token-level entropy because it captures genuine uncertainty about the answer rather than uncertainty about how to phrase it. The theory predicts that semantic entropy will outperform token-level methods especially for tasks where correct answers have many valid phrasings, and will be more robust to prompt variations and model differences. The approach can be implemented either with full probability distributions (when available) or as discrete semantic entropy using empirical cluster counts (for black-box models), and requires careful attention to sampling diversity, entailment model quality, and the number of samples used.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

High-entropy orderings (where the model is uncertain about which pattern to follow) lead to high variance across different orderings, while low-entropy orderings (where the model confidently identifies a pattern) lead to stable predictions. The theory proposes that entropy-based selection methods (GlobalE, LocalE) work by identifying example orderings that minimize this uncertainty, effectively finding 'consensus' orderings where the model's interpretation is unambiguous. This mechanism operates through the autoregressive nature of language models, where each token's prediction depends on all previous tokens, making order a critical determinant of the context trajectory. The theory explains why entropy-based selection outperforms random selection and why the effect is consistent across model sizes and tasks, while also accounting for why the optimal ordering is model-specific due to different inductive biases.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Aligned models exhibit lower next-token entropy, which reduces sensitivity to decoding hyperparameters and prompt variations, but this comes at the cost of reduced output diversity and potential overcautiousness. The theory posits a three-way trade-off: (1) low entropy → high stability but low diversity, (2) high entropy → high diversity but low stability, (3) alignment strength controls the position in this trade-off space. Critically, alignment acts as a 'variance regularizer' that compresses the output distribution, making behavior more predictable but potentially less capable of exploring the full solution space. This explains why aligned models show lower RDP, reduced prompt sensitivity, and more consistent behavior across runs, but may underperform on tasks requiring diverse exploration.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Highly constrained tasks (multiple choice, classification, short-form QA with verifiable answers) naturally suppress stochastic variation by forcing outputs into discrete, verifiable categories, while open-ended tasks (creative generation, long-form reasoning, subjective evaluation) allow stochastic processes to compound. This relationship is quantifiable: variance scales approximately with the logarithm of the effective output space size, further modulated by model entropy (alignment reduces entropy and thus variance) and the availability of verification mechanisms (unit tests, ground truth, automatic metrics). The theory predicts that task reformulation (e.g., converting open-ended to multiple-choice, adding verification steps) can reduce variance without changing the underlying model or sampling procedure. However, prompt sensitivity acts as an orthogonal source of variance that can affect even highly constrained tasks, and must be controlled separately.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The theory predicts that: spectral methods require similar eigenstructure and degree distributions; diffusion methods require consistent flow dynamics and appropriate directionality; message-passing methods require meaningful neighborhood aggregation; and topology-based methods (e.g., centrality measures) transfer most broadly because they rely only on connectivity patterns. Violations of assumptions require either architectural adaptation (e.g., modifying operators for undirected graphs) or explicit constraint encoding (e.g., physical reachability masks).

Domain randomization succeeds by forcing invariance to synthetic artifacts through extreme variation, while photorealistic synthesis succeeds by minimizing the domain gap. Task-specific filtering (e.g., Precision-Recall based on auxiliary detectors) is more effective than general quality metrics (e.g., FID) because it directly evaluates whether generated objects meet task requirements rather than overall image realism.

The value of explicit domain knowledge integration varies systematically with: (a) the strength of domain constraints, (b) the availability of training data, (c) the consequences of errors, (d) the need for interpretability, and (e) the degree of domain shift. In highly constrained domains with limited data and high error costs, methods providing explicit mechanisms for domain knowledge integration substantially outperform purely data-driven approaches. However, as data quantity increases and constraints weaken, the relative advantage of explicit knowledge integration diminishes, and data-driven methods may achieve comparable or superior performance.

Transfer is most successful when: (1) minimal adaptation yields substantial benefit (high efficiency), (2) adaptation effort is within available resources and expertise (feasibility), (3) adapted method outperforms domain-specific alternatives (superiority), and (4) supporting infrastructure and community resources reduce effective adaptation costs. The theory predicts that methods requiring extensive domain-specific modification will only be adopted when they provide substantial performance advantages or when no adequate alternatives exist, while methods requiring minimal adaptation will be adopted even for modest improvements. This creates a 'transfer adoption landscape' where ease of adaptation, performance gain, infrastructure availability, and community support jointly determine practical success. Importantly, effective adaptation effort decreases over time as tools, documentation, and expertise accumulate, creating adoption tipping points where initially high-effort methods become accessible.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

This alignment enables: (1) zero-shot transfer of spatial reasoning from vision to language, (2) grounding of spatial language through visual similarity, (3) compositional generalization by combining aligned concepts, and (4) implicit spatial priors encoded in the alignment. The quality of spatial reasoning depends on: alignment strength, coverage of spatial concepts in training data, the structure of the shared embedding space, and the type of spatial knowledge required (perceptual attributes vs relational reasoning vs metric precision). Models can leverage this alignment even when operating purely on text by accessing the spatially-grounded regions of the embedding space. However, alignment-based spatial knowledge has limitations: it may be insufficient for precise metric reasoning, can be outperformed by text-only models on certain relational tasks, and shows varying effectiveness across different spatial reference frames and relation types.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

This iterative approach compensates for the limited working memory and planning horizon of autoregressive language models. Key mechanisms include: explicit memory modules tracking completed steps and robot status, multi-round planning with state-conditioned generation, error detection and correction (both internal consistency checking and external execution feedback), simulation-based state prediction, and solver-based verification. Performance generally scales with iteration count up to a saturation point, after which error accumulation or overfitting can degrade performance. The effectiveness of iteration depends critically on: (1) the quality and completeness of state representations, (2) the reliability of feedback signals, (3) the task horizon and complexity, and (4) the computational budget available.

Models preferentially encode and reason at the qualitative level due to its prevalence in language training data, but struggle with metric precision without explicit numeric representations. Effective spatial reasoning requires translating between levels: qualitative relations for high-level planning and natural language grounding, metric coordinates for precise execution and geometric computation, geometric understanding for collision checking and feasibility assessment, and affordances for action selection and embodiment grounding. Systems that provide explicit representations at multiple levels (e.g., qualitative spatial calculi + coordinate maps + 3D geometry + learned affordances) consistently outperform those operating at a single level. The hierarchy is not strictly sequential—models can operate at different levels for different subtasks—but translation between levels remains a key bottleneck, with qualitative-to-metric conversion being particularly challenging.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

This theory explains why code-generation approaches often outperform natural language planning, why explicit skill libraries reduce hallucination, and why symbolic program representations enable capabilities (formal verification, compositional reuse, deterministic execution) that are difficult or impossible with natural language alone.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Standard positional encodings (absolute, sinusoidal, RoPE) create OOD representations for unseen lengths. Interventions that improve length generalization include: randomized positional encodings (exposing models to diverse position values), relative positional encodings (position-independent representations), format alignment (reversed digits reduce dependency length, padding standardizes positions), fine-grained tokenization (single-digit tokens enable consistent digit-wise learning), curriculum learning (progressive exposure to longer sequences), and training-set priming (small number of longer examples during training).

This approach works because: (1) models are better at generating structured code than performing precise numeric operations token-by-token, (2) external interpreters provide deterministic, exact computation free from the accumulation errors inherent in autoregressive generation, (3) program generation separates semantic understanding and problem decomposition (which the model handles well) from numeric execution (which the interpreter handles perfectly), (4) code-pretrained models have strong priors for generating syntactically correct programs, and (5) programming languages provide explicit, consistent constructs for numeric operations (e.g., len(), objects[-1]) that are more reliable than variable natural language expressions. The effectiveness of this approach depends critically on: the model's code generation ability (dramatically improved by code pretraining like Codex/Code-Llama), the expressiveness of the target language and available libraries (SymPy for symbolic math, NumPy for numeric operations), the model's ability to correctly ground problem variables to program variables (the primary failure mode), and the availability of an execution environment. This delegation strategy (PoT, PAL, Prolog generation) consistently and substantially outperforms direct answer generation (CoT) on computation-heavy tasks, with gains ranging from modest (few percentage points) to dramatic (20+ percentage points), with larger gains on more computation-intensive problems. Hybrid approaches that attempt program generation first and fall back to natural language reasoning when programs are non-executable achieve the best overall performance by combining the precision of delegation with the flexibility of natural language reasoning.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Single-digit tokenization (one token per digit) enables learning of digit-wise algorithmic procedures because: (1) it creates consistent token-to-digit alignment across all numbers, (2) it allows the model to learn position-invariant digit operations, (3) it provides sufficient training examples for each digit combination (only 10 digits vs. 100+ multi-digit tokens), and (4) it enables length generalization by making the algorithm independent of number magnitude. Multi-digit tokenization (e.g., 2-digit or 3-digit chunks via BPE) creates a combinatorially large token space (100 for 2-digit, 1000 for 3-digit), inconsistent alignments (similar numbers map to different token sequences), and insufficient training coverage, preventing algorithm learning and causing models to rely on memorization or heuristics. This effect is most pronounced for smaller models (<10B parameters) and becomes less critical but still important for larger models. The theory also encompasses tokenization direction effects: the direction of greedy tokenization (left-to-right vs right-to-left) interacts with digit ordering to affect carry/borrow locality, with right-to-left tokenization better supporting little-endian (LSB-first) output formats.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Pretrained token embeddings supply these Fourier basis features as a result of language pretraining, which are then combined through the forward pass via phase-shifting of sin/cos coefficients to align peaks with correct numeric values. Models trained from scratch without pretraining fail to develop these sparse high-frequency features and consequently show characteristic off-by-one errors and poor modular arithmetic, achieving only ~94% accuracy compared to ~99.7% for pretrained models on addition tasks.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Models primarily memorize input-output mappings for frequent, simple problems seen during training, but must rely on learned algorithmic procedures for rare or complex problems. The balance is not binary but exists on a continuum, with models often using hybrid strategies (e.g., memorizing common patterns while computing novel combinations). Key evidence for memorization includes: perfect in-distribution accuracy with sharp out-of-distribution failure, sensitivity to training data frequency, ability to produce correct answers despite incorrect intermediate steps, and correlation with benchmark contamination. Key evidence for computation includes: generalization to unseen problems, systematic error patterns consistent with algorithmic failures (carry errors, off-by-one), internal representations that align with algorithmic steps (Fourier features for addition, attention patterns for operand gathering), and improved performance with step-by-step training. The memorization-computation balance can be shifted through: tokenization choices (digit-level favors computation), format optimization (reversed order, padding), step-by-step supervision, pretraining on mathematical data, and architectural choices. Critically, the theory recognizes that memorization and computation are not mutually exclusive - models can memorize frequent sub-patterns while computing their combinations, and can memorize input-output mappings while failing to learn correct intermediate algorithms.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Specifically, reversing digit order (least-significant-digit first, 'little-endian') dramatically improves learning and generalization because it aligns the autoregressive generation order with the natural flow of carry propagation in arithmetic algorithms. In standard left-to-right (most-significant-digit first) format, the model must predict output digits that depend on carries from future (not-yet-generated) digits, creating long-range dependencies that exceed transformer capacity. Reversing to right-to-left format makes each output digit depend only on local context and previously-generated carries, reducing the 'Count of Sequential Intermediate Digits' (CSID) from O(n²) to O(1) for multiplication and enabling reliable learning. This format dependency is amplified by tokenization choices: digit-level tokenization is necessary to fully realize format benefits, and tokenization direction (left-to-right vs right-to-left greedy segmentation) interacts with digit ordering. Additionally, padding inputs to fixed width standardizes absolute positional patterns across examples, enabling the model to learn position-relative rules. Format consistency between pretraining and fine-tuning also matters, as format mismatches can require 'unlearning' and reduce adaptation efficiency. These format effects explain why identical models show order-of-magnitude performance differences based solely on representation choices.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

When tasks share latent structure (common underlying features or dimensions), unsupervised learning discovers these shared components and creates representations that facilitate positive transfer and compositional generalization. When tasks have independent structure, unsupervised learning orthogonalizes their representations, reducing interference. This process is particularly effective during blocked training because sustained exposure to one task context allows unsupervised mechanisms to converge on that task's structure before switching to another task. Unsupervised pretraining on task structure (even without labels) can substantially improve subsequent supervised learning efficiency and transfer. This mechanism explains why humans can rapidly learn new tasks that recombine familiar features and why blocked training facilitates both learning and transfer.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing</td>

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Structural Synaptic Allocation Hypothesis<br><b>Description:</b> Long-term protection of multiple task memories from interference is achieved through structural allocation of dendritic spines to different dendritic branches for different tasks. When a new task is learned, task-specific patterns of neural activity drive the formation of new dendritic spines on specific branches. These newly formed spines are preferentially stabilized if they contribute to successful task performance, creating a structural memory trace. Critically, different tasks drive spine formation on different branches of the same neurons, physically separating the synaptic substrates of different memories. This structural allocation provides long-term protection because synaptic modifications for one task (on one set of branches) do not directly overwrite synapses for another task (on different branches). The mechanism complements functional partitioning: while functional mechanisms (context gating, representational geometry) reduce interference during online performance, structural mechanisms provide offline protection and long-term stability. Structural allocation is particularly important for memories that must be retained over long timescales (weeks to lifetime) and may be less critical for short-term or working memory.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing</td>

When context signals are temporally autocorrelated (sustained over many trials in blocked training), unsupervised Hebbian plasticity mechanisms can effectively orthogonalize the synaptic weight vectors associated with different contexts. This occurs because Hebbian rules like Oja's rule converge to principal components of the input covariance structure, and temporally sustained contexts create distinct covariance patterns. In contrast, rapidly switching contexts during interleaved training prevent Hebbian mechanisms from discovering and orthogonalizing these patterns because the covariance structure is mixed. The sluggish (exponentially decaying) nature of context signals further enhances this effect by providing a temporal integration window that smooths over trial-to-trial noise during blocked training but blurs context boundaries during interleaved training. This mechanism specifically explains why humans benefit from blocking while standard artificial neural networks (which lack Hebbian mechanisms and context gating) suffer catastrophic forgetting under the same conditions.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span></td>

For tasks requiring independent solutions (different rules for same stimuli), the brain expands representations into high-dimensional space and then partitions them into orthogonal low-dimensional subspaces, with each task occupying its own subspace. This compression of task-irrelevant dimensions and separation of task-relevant dimensions minimizes interference. Conversely, for tasks sharing common structure, the brain maintains mixed selectivity and high-dimensional codes that multiplex task variables, enabling flexible linear readout and positive transfer. The choice between partitioning (low-dimensional orthogonal subspaces) and multiplexing (high-dimensional mixed codes) is determined by task statistics, learning schedule, and the degree of shared structure. Unsupervised learning mechanisms (Hebbian plasticity) discover the latent structure and determine the appropriate dimensionality, while supervised mechanisms fine-tune readouts.

Simultaneously, structural synaptic mechanisms allocate new dendritic spines to different branches for different tasks, providing long-term physical protection of task-specific memories. At the functional level, context-dependent gating and Hebbian orthogonalization partition cortical representations into task-specific subspaces. These mechanisms work synergistically: hippocampal replay internally interleaves experiences to prevent catastrophic forgetting during consolidation, while cortical partitioning reduces interference during online performance.

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Model Size, Training Data Quality, and Fine-Tuning Drive First-Order ToM Performance in LLMs<br><b>Description:</b> The ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform first-order theory-of-mind (ToM) tasks is influenced by a combination of model size, the quality and diversity of training data, and targeted fine-tuning or instruction tuning on ToM-specific or socially rich datasets. While larger models generally show improved ToM performance, diminishing returns occur at very large scales, making fine-tuning and data quality critical factors. Diverse training data, especially rich in social narratives and multilingual content, enhances ToM reasoning capabilities. However, strong performance on benchmarks does not necessarily imply genuine understanding or functional ToM capabilities, as models may rely on heuristics and show variability due to factors beyond size and data, such as architecture, fine-tuning methods, and evaluation design. Current ToM benchmarks may overestimate LLMs' true ToM abilities due to oversimplified tasks and lack of adversarial robustness. Smaller models can improve ToM performance substantially through fine-tuning and novel inference-time methods, partially mitigating size limitations.<br><b>Derived From:</b> <a href="theories/theory-17.html">[theory-17]</a></td>

This absence limits their ability to form robust mental state representations and to connect linguistic inferences to actual social cognition.</td>

This approach reduces systematic errors and improves out-of-distribution generalization on arithmetic tasks.
