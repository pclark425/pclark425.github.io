                <p><strong>Extraction Query:</strong> Extract any mentions of population differences in the prevalence of activating EGFR mutations in lung cancer and proposed reasons for higher frequency in East Asians. Include quantitative evidence about mutation frequencies by ancestry, smoking status, sex, and age; germline variants and their allele frequencies/associations; environmental and hormonal exposures; mutational signatures and tumor mutation burden; co-mutation patterns; and differential response to EGFR-TKIs by ethnicity. Capture study design, methods, and any counter-evidence or limitations.</p>
