                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Molecular Epidemiology of the Main Druggable Genetic Alterations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the leading cause of death for malignancy worldwide. Its molecular profiling has enriched our understanding of cancer initiation and progression and has become fundamental to provide guidance on treatment with targeted therapies. Testing the presence of driver mutations in specific genes in lung tumors has thus radically changed the clinical management and outcomes of the disease. Numerous studies performed with traditional sequencing methods have investigated the occurrence of such mutations in lung cancer, and new insights regarding their frequency and clinical significance are continuously provided with the use of last generation sequencing technologies. In this review, we discuss the molecular epidemiology of the main druggable genetic alterations in non-small cell lung cancer, namely EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, MET, and HER2 mutations or amplification, as well as ALK and ROS1 fusions. Furthermore, we investigated the predictive impact of these alterations on the outcomes of modern targeted therapies, their global prognostic significance, and their mutual interaction in cases of co-occurrence.</p>

Meta-analysis cited (167 studies) shows increasing smoking history (pack-years) decreases odds of EGFR mutations, especially >30 pack-years. The paper also notes that among non-smokers, Caucasian non-smokers may show relatively greater mutation prevalence compared to Asian non-smokers (i.e., the smoking-association effect interacts with ethnicity). EGFR mutations are also more frequent in females.</td>

As for reasons why mutations are more common in certain populations, the paper does not provide concrete molecular causal mechanisms but mentions hypotheses: inherent non-environmental (genetic) susceptibility in Asians and/or alternative mechanisms of lung cancer development in Asians (i.e., different etiologic pathways). It also emphasizes that lower smoking prevalence (a strong environmental factor inversely associated with EGFR mutations) in certain demographic subsets (women, never-smokers) contributes to higher observed EGFR frequencies, though this does not fully explain the ethnic disparities.</td>

(2) Possible inherent non-environmental (genetic/germline) susceptibility in Asians that predisposes to EGFR-mutant lung cancers (paper cites studies proposing 'alternative mechanisms' or 'inherent non-environmental susceptibility' but does not name specific variants). (3) Ethnic/geographic variation in exposure to tobacco and other lung carcinogens (smoking inversely associated with EGFR mutations). (4) Study/selection factors and histologic composition (many figures specifically refer to adenocarcinoma cohorts); methodological heterogeneity across studies may amplify apparent differences. The review emphasizes the true reasons remain unclear and are likely multifactorial.</td>

(2) Reported frequencies vary widely across studies (e.g., 'up to 78%' in East Asian adenocarcinomas vs '40-50%' in Table 1 for Asians vs '10-16%' in Western populations), indicating study heterogeneity and selection bias. (3) Middle East and African populations show frequencies slightly higher than Western but lower than Asian, complicating a simple East vs non-East dichotomy. (4) The review is based on aggregated literature (not a single uniform dataset), so differences in testing methods, case mix (adenocarcinoma-enriched vs all NSCLC), and sample selection confound direct comparisons.</td>
