                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> The Current Roadmap of Lung Cancer Biology, Genomics and Racial Disparity</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Globally, lung cancer is the most prevalent cause of cancer-related death. There are two large histological groups of lung cancer: small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Based on histopathological and molecular features, adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the two major histologic subtypes of NSCLC. Various epidemiological and environmental factors are linked with an increased risk of lung cancer. However, these risk factors show disparities in patients with divergent racial and ethnic backgrounds. Interestingly, different populations were found to harbor distinct molecular features as evidenced by variations in genetic mutation profiles. Moreover, diverse histological and molecular progression patterns are identified in lung cancer, which could be crucial in improving diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic planning. In concert with a plethora of nuclear genetic alterations, mitochondrial alteration, epigenetic reprogramming, microbial dysbiosis, and immune alteration signatures have been identified in various lung cancer types. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of screening tests and the treatment strategies for NSCLC and SCLC, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies. Through the unification of these diverse aspects, this review article aspires to a complete understanding of lung cancer’s genomics, biology, microbial landscapes, and racial disparity and seeks to understand the essential role of racial and ethnic factors in lung cancer occurrence and treatment.</p>

The review explicitly states 'EGFR and KRAS mutation frequencies were significantly correlated with genetic ancestry in LUAD patients from Latin America.'
• Never-smoker status: review notes LUAD is more common in never-smokers with predominant EGFR mutation and that EGFR mutations are enriched in early-stage lesions and never-smoker tumors.
• Mitochondrial co-alterations: the review cites Dasgupta et al. (2012) and other mitochondrial studies showing mtDNA mutations are enriched in never-smoker NSCLC patients and show a significant association between mtDNA changes and EGFR gene mutation, and that mtDNA mutation prevalence was higher in never-smoker Asian populations compared to current-smoker EA populations.
• Environmental/lifestyle: the review cites region-specific exposures (air pollution, Chinese-style cooking, passive smoking) as established lung cancer risk factors that could interact with genetic risk; it also cites gene–environment interactions (XME polymorphisms) that change susceptibility.
• Clinical correlations: the review cites that EGFR mutations are associated with better survival and that Asian populations with higher EGFR frequency have longer survival and higher chemotherapy responses in some studies.</td>

• Geographic/ethnic heterogeneity: the review highlights regional exceptions (e.g., Tunisian LUAD patients had lower percentages of EGFR and KRAS mutations compared with European or Asian series), and an Indian LUSC cohort had 5.8% EGFR mutations — showing that local/population-level variation can deviate from the broad East-Asian > non-East-Asian pattern.
• The review emphasizes that many observations are associative: while ancestry correlations are reported, causal mechanisms remain unproven within the cited literature and confounding factors (smoking prevalence, screening/diagnosis differences, socioeconomic and healthcare access) can influence observed frequencies.</td>

                            <td>• Higher EGFR prevalence in East Asian LUAD underpins the clinical need for routine EGFR molecular testing in these populations and supports widespread use of EGFR-targeted therapies (EGFR TKIs) in mutation-positive patients. The review also states EGFR mutations are associated with improved survival compared with some other drivers. • Ethnic differences in driver frequencies influence which targeted therapies and testing panels should be prioritized regionally. • Heterogeneity and exceptions imply universal testing (not presumptive testing by ethnicity alone) remains important.</td>
