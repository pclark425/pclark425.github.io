                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> New Frontiers for Molecular Pathology</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer remains a serious oncological problem worldwide. The delayed diagnosis and a prevalence of advanced stages in up to 70% of cases at recognition are still observed. Thanks to targeted therapies and immunotherapy a significant progress in achieving prolonged survival in some lung cancer patients is reported. A precise histopathological diagnosis, especially the recognition of adenocarcinoma, and a progress in the methods of clinical staging underlie the proper qualification of patients for a tailored therapy. The deep molecular characteristics of lung cancer in liquid biopsy, for example blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), cell suspension from needle aspirates, are currently available. The molecular characteristic has recently been extended with molecular aberrations of BRAF, KRAS, MET, ERBB2, RET, NTRK next to the well-known EGFR mutations and ALK, ROS-1 relocation. The present paper discusses the usefulness of adequate pathological methods and molecular testing for the identification of a broad spectrum of predictive biomarkers for a molecular-directed lung cancer therapy. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is approved in the first line therapy of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. To date only PD-L1 expression on tumor cells has been found to be a marker of response to ICIs. The efficacy of ICIs as well as the susceptibility to immune-related adverse events are highly individual, so immune biomarkers are widely investigated. The candidates for predictive factors for ICIs immunotherapy include cancer cell antigenicity, presence of regulatory/suppressory molecules on cancer cells, cancer stem cells or on exosomes, and, on the other hand, an immune status of the patient. Cancers with high immune infiltration in the tumor milieu, referred to as “hot” tumors, seem to ensure a better response to ICIs than the “cold” ones. BALF analysis may replace cancer tissue examination, which is of limited access in advanced stages, for the recognition of the nature of immune response in the tumor environment. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was shown to correlate with a good response to ICIs, especially when combined with other anticancer therapies. The present paper demonstrates the results of recent studies on lung cancer characteristics which bring us closer to the definition of useful prognostic/predictive factors.</p>

(c) Multi-region exome sequencing in Asian EGFR-mutant ADC (cited Nahar et al.) showing differences in intratumoral architecture and that never-smokers tend to have a truncal driver with fewer co-drivers.

(2) Measurement difficulties for environmental exposures like environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are noted, limiting strength of environmental-etiology arguments. (3) No direct genetic/ancestry studies or founder-effect evidence are provided in this review to prove a germline-ancestry basis for higher EGFR prevalence in East Asians. (4) The review states that despite observed prevalence differences, these have not (yet) changed therapeutic choice algorithms, implying limited mechanistic/clinical resolution to date.</td>
