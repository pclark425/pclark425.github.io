                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Catalog of Lung Cancer Gene Mutations Among Chinese Patients</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background: Detailed catalog of lung cancer-associated gene mutations provides valuable information for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. In China, there has never been a wide-ranging study cataloging lung cancer-associated gene mutations. This study aims to reveal a comprehensive catalog of lung cancer gene mutations in china, focusing on EGFR, ALK, KRAS, HER2, PIK3CA, MET, BRAF, HRAS, and CTNNB1 as major targets. Additionally, we also aim to correlate smoking history, gender, and age distribution and pathological types with various types of gene mutations. Patients and Methods: A retrospective data acquisition was conducted spanning 6 years (2013–2018) among all patients who underwent lung cancer surgeries not bronchial or percutaneous lung biopsy at three major tertiary hospitals. Finally, we identified 1,729 patients who matched our inclusion criteria. Results: 1081 patients (62.49%) harbored EGFR mutation. ALK (n = 42, 2.43%), KRAS (n = 201, 11.62%), CTNNB1 (n = 28, 1.62%), BRAF (n = 31, 1.79%), PIK3CA (n = 51, 2.95%), MET (n = 14, 0.81%), HER2 (n = 47, 2.72%), HRAS (n = 3, 0.17%), and other genes(n = 232, 13.4%). Females expressed 55.38% vs. males 44.62% mutations. Among subjects with known smoking histories, 32.82% smokers, 67.15% non-smokers were observed. Generally, 51.80% patients were above 60 years vs. 48.20% in younger patients. Pathological types found includes LUADs 71.11%, SQCCs 1.68%, ASC 0.75%, LCC 0.58%, SCC 0.35%, ACC 0.17%, and SC 0.06%, unclear 25.19%. Conclusion: We offer a detailed catalog of the distribution of lung cancer mutations. Showing how gender, smoking history, age, and pathological types are significantly related to the prevalence of lung cancer in China.</p>

(c) Lack of direct causal genetic evidence in this study — associations are observational and confounded by smoking, sex, and age.
