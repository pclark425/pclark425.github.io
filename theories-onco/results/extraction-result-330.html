                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Prevalence of driver mutations in non-small-cell lung cancers in the People’s Republic of China</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and in the People’s Republic of China. Recently, the pathological proportions of the various forms of lung cancer have changed. A shift to a preponderance of adenocarcinoma at the expense of squamous cell carcinoma is observable. Treatment decisions have historically been based on tumor histology, and evolution of our molecular understanding of cancer has led to development of targeted therapeutic agents. It is essential to further understand mutations that drive cancer development (driver mutations) in relevant genes and their effects on cancer cell proliferation and survival. The epidemiology of lung cancer in the People’s Republic of China has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. However, molecular epidemiological data from mainland China are scarce. Consequently, we herein review the prevalence of driver mutations in Chinese patients.</p>
