                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Mutational Analysis of EGFR Mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma—An Indian Perspective of 212 Patients</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the world’s leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the critical oncogenes and plays a significant role in tumor proliferation and metastasis. Patients with sensitizing mutations in the EGFR gene have better clinical outcomes when treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). This study expands our knowledge of the spectrum of EGFR mutations among lung cancer patients in the Indian scenario. This is a retrospective descriptive study of all newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer in tertiary care hospital in India. All the samples were subjected to real-time PCR (q-PCR) analysis and confirmation of rare novel mutations was done using Sanger sequencing. Clinicopathological characteristics, mutational EGFR status, and location on the exon and metastatic sites were evaluated. An analysis of total 212 samples showed mutations in 38.67% of cases. Among these, five (5.9%) samples had mutations in exon 18, 41 (48.8%) samples had mutations in exon 19, 12 (14.28%) samples had mutations in exon 20, and 26 (30.95%) samples had mutations in exon 21. Eleven (13.41%) were found to be uncommon EGFR mutations. Additionally, six (21.4%) samples that had EGFR mutations were also positive for brain metastasis. Future testing on bigger panels will help to characterize the incidence of genetic mutations and to determine the appropriate targeted treatment choices for NSCLC patients.</p>
