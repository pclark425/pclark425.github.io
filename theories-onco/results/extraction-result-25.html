                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Common Mutations: New Strategies</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Simple Summary The prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer with common EGFR mutations remains poor, despite the results obtained with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Disease progression during targeted therapy is linked to the development of resistance mechanisms. This literature review aims to summarize and clarify the main therapeutic strategies developed to address this important unmet medical need, including the latest updated and recently presented data.</p>
