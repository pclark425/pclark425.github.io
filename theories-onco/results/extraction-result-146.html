                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Recent biological advances in tumor research provide clear evidence that lung cancer in females is different from that in males. These differences appear to have a direct impact on the clinical presentation, histology, and outcomes of lung cancer. Women are more likely to present with lung adenocarcinoma, tend to receive a diagnosis at an earlier age, and are more likely to be diagnosed with localized disease. Women may also be more predisposed to molecular aberrations resulting from the carcinogenic effects of tobacco, but do not appear to be more susceptible than men to developing lung cancer. The gender differences found in female lung cancer make it mandatory that gender stratification is used in clinical trials in order to improve the survival rates of patients with lung cancer.</p>

The paper also references HPV/aromatase→estrogen→EGFR activation as a speculative pathway enhancing vulnerability of female never-smokers.</td>

The authors argue for routine molecular testing and possible tumor reclassification to guide treatment decisions, particularly in populations with high mutation prevalence.</td>
