                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Utilizing Publicly Available Cancer Clinicogenomic Data on CBioPortal to Compare Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutant and Wildtype Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Publicly available clinicogenomic data on platforms such as the cancer BioPortal (cBioPortal.org) allow for efficient analyses by researchers with little or no experience working with Big Data. cBioPortal.org also allows for appropriate statistical testing and downloadable images for easy dissemination of findings. In this study, the cBioPortal.org platform was tested and its utility demonstrated by comparing cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with and without epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutations. Patients with EGFR mutations were more likely to be female, of Asian ethnicity, never-smokers, and be diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. Metastasis to the pleura, pleural fluid, and liver was common in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC. On the other hand, lymph node, brain, and adrenal gland metastases were more common in patients with other mutations. While the median overall survival was about the same in the two groups, progression-free survival was significantly shorter in the EGFR mutant group. The mutational landscape was significantly different in the two groups with EGFR mutant NSCLCs having a lower mutational burden. Differences in copy number alterations between the two groups were also noted. The descriptive data generated from this study such as age, gender, smoking history, and histological subtype recapitulate findings of other studies on EGFR mutant NSCLCs. Further prospective and/or preclinical studies are needed to confirm differences noted in this study. cBioPortal.com queries may be used to supplement clinical/pre-clinical studies or to generate novel hypotheses.</p>
