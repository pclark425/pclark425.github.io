                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Prevalence of EGFR Mutations in Lung Cancer in Uruguayan Population</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background Incorporation of molecular analysis of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene into routine clinical practice represents a milestone for personalized therapy of the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the genetic testing of EGFR mutations has not yet become a routine clinical practice in developing countries. In view of different prevalence of such mutations among different ethnicities and geographic regions, as well as the limited existing data from Latin America, our aim was to study the frequency of major types of activating mutations of the EGFR gene in NSCLC patients from Uruguay. Methods We examined EGFR mutations in exons 18 through 21 in 289 NSCLC Uruguayan patients by PCR-direct sequencing. Results EGFR mutations were detected in 53 of the 289 (18.3%) patients, more frequently in women (23.4%) than in men (14.5%). The distribution by exon was similar to that generally reported in the literature. Conclusions This first epidemiological study of EGFR mutations in Uruguay reveals a wide spectrum of mutations and an overall prevalence of 18.3%. The background ethnic structure of the Uruguayan population could play an important role in explaining our findings.</p>
