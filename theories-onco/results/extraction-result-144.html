                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> <a href="http://jtd.amegroups.com/article/download/31431/pdf" target="_blank">Differences in molecular epidemiology of lung cancer among ethnicities (Asian vs. Caucasian)</a></p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background Differences in carcinogenesis and therapeutic efficacy according to ethnicity have been reported for lung cancer, and understanding differences in genetic mutation profiles among ethnicities is important for interpreting the results of clinical trials, preventing carcinogenesis, and individualizing treatment. However, no studies have focused on differences in mutation profiles among different ethnicities using large-scale genomic analysis data with detailed information on smoking history, the main cause of lung cancer. Methods To clarify the differences in genetic mutation profiles between Caucasian and Japanese subjects, we compared data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, which mainly included Caucasians, with results from the Japan Molecular Epidemiology for lung cancer study, which is an epidemiological study only involving Japanese subjects. We divided the participants into four groups according to smoking status and performed comparative analysis by tissue type (lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer). Results In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, the frequency of EGFR mutations was lower in Caucasian subjects than in Japanese subjects (14.6% vs. 51.1%), whereas the frequencies of mutations in other genes, namely KRAS (32.9% vs. 9.3%), TP53 (45.2% vs. 20.7%), BRAF (9.6% vs. 1.3%), PIK3CA (5.9% vs. 2.6%), KEAP1 (17.8% vs. 0.5%), NF1 (10.9% vs. 0.5%), STK11 (17.8% vs. 0.7%), RBM10 (8.7% vs. 0.1%), and MET (7.8% vs. 0.1%), were higher in Caucasian subjects. Among patients with squamous cell carcinoma, TP53 (81.2% vs. 49.1%), PIK3CA (14.5% vs. 6.8%), KEAP1 (12.7% vs. 0.9%), and NFE2L2 mutations (15.8% vs. 13.6%) were more common in Caucasian subjects. Conclusions Ethnicity is an important and complex characteristic that must be recognized and considered, even in the era of precision medicine. We should collaborate to share data for different ethnicities and incorporate them into clinical practice and the design of global clinical studies. Carefully designed molecular epidemiological studies focusing on ethnic differences are warranted.</p>

Clin Cancer Res 2011; other ETS registry analyses), (b) reports of population polymorphisms affecting EGFR expression in Asians (cited as prior work). 3) Observed mutual exclusivity pattern between EGFR and KRAS mutations: KRAS mutations are much more common in TCGA (Caucasians) while EGFR is much more common in JME (Japanese), supporting differing molecular etiologies. 4) Observations linking EGFR enrichment with female sex, adenocarcinoma histology and never-smoker status (consistent with prior literature and replicated in both cohorts).</td>

                            <td>1) Conflicting reports about ETS: the authors cite studies with inconsistent findings regarding the ETS–EGFR mutation relationship (they cite conflicting data in refs 13,14). 2) The JME/TCGA comparison cannot definitively separate genetic ancestry from environmental/cultural differences because TCGA is not a purely Caucasian cohort (contains multiple ethnicities) and because the two datasets differ in ascertainment, staging, and mutation-detection methods. 3) The paper did not perform direct germline or ancestry analyses, so claims about inherited polymorphisms remain speculative within this study. 4) The authors explicitly state they could not confirm impacts of environmental factors other than smoking and that the exact mechanisms remain unclear—i.e., negative/null direct evidence is lacking in this analysis.</td>

                            <td>1) High EGFR mutation prevalence in Japanese/East Asian patients implies a greater proportion of patients who may benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors; ethnicity should be considered when designing and interpreting global clinical trials and in treatment decision-making. 2) Ethnicity (Japanese/East Asian) and never-smoking status are associated with more favorable prognoses and differential responses/toxicities reported in prior literature; thus ethnicity-informed stratification is recommended. 3) Differences in other mutation frequencies and TMB may impact immunotherapy response and prognosis, necessitating ethnically representative biomarker-driven strategies.</td>
