                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Coal–PAH Environmental Signature Theory of Regionally Distinct EGFR Mutational Spectra</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why EGFR activating mutations in exons 18-21 in lung cancer are more common in East Asian populations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Chronic exposure to high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related mutagenic compounds from indoor coal combustion and coal mining activities induces a characteristic shift in the EGFR mutational spectrum in lung cancers among exposed populations. Specifically, these populations have a higher frequency of EGFR exon 18 (G719X) and exon 20 (S768I, G719X+S768I) mutations, along with a higher prevalence of G>T and T>G transversions in both the EGFR and TP53 genes, compared to matched populations with similar ancestry but lower environmental exposure. This pattern contrasts with the exon 19 deletion/exon 21 L858R-dominant profile observed in most global East Asian and non-Asian populations and serves as a molecular signature of environment-driven carcinogenesis.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Environmental Mutagen-Induced Spectrum Shift Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In populations experiencing chronic, high-level exposure to coal-derived PAHs and particulate matter, there is a statistically significant increase in the frequency and proportion of EGFR exon 18 (G719X) and exon 20 (S768I, G719X+S768I) mutations among EGFR-positive lung cancers, as well as an increased absolute frequency of G>T and T>G transversions in both EGFR and TP53 coding regions, compared to populations of similar ancestry but with lower exposure.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to human populations residing in coal-producing or coal-burning regions in East Yunnan (Qujing), Xuanwei, Southwestern China, and comparable high-exposure coal/PAH environments, particularly where chronic indoor and outdoor coal use (poor ventilation, household/fuel usage) or occupational mining is prevalent. The law is specific to the observed EGFR/TP53 mutational spectra in lung cancer and does not necessarily generalize to all somatic mutation processes in other tissue types.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In coal-exposed populations with simultaneous high prevalence of other mutagenic exposures (radon, heavy metals), spectrum may combine or blur into composite patterns.</li>
                <li>If coal-exposed individuals move to low-exposure environments and sufficiently reduce their exposure duration, their somatic mutation risk profile may partially revert toward the non-exposed population spectrum (time/dose dependency).</li>
                <li>Within-person/household exposure may be gender-dependent (e.g., indoor cooking), creating intra-population substructure.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Coal-producing East Yunnan: Significantly higher rates of EGFR G719X (9.9%, p=0.011) and G719X+S768I compound mutations (24.14%, p<0.001), alongside increased G>T/T>G transversions in overall EGFR point mutations and in TP53 in coal-area patients vs. non-coal areas. Multivariate analysis identifies coal-producing area as independent predictor of mutational shift. <a href="../results/extraction-result-175.html#e175.0" class="evidence-link">[e175.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-175.html#e175.2" class="evidence-link">[e175.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Coal-area patients had lower overall EGFR mutation frequency (44.44% in coal vs 51.46% in non-coal) but relative and absolute frequencies of rare EGFR mutations (G719X, G719X+S768I) were markedly higher. TP53: G>T point mutations higher in coal-area patients (50.83% vs 29.23%, p=0.005), consistent with PAH mutagenesis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-175.html#e175.0" class="evidence-link">[e175.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-175.html#e175.2" class="evidence-link">[e175.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Non-coal producing Han populations (same region/ancestry) show preservation of global East Asian pattern—exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R dominant, and markedly lower prevalence of G719X/compound mutations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-175.html#e175.0" class="evidence-link">[e175.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.2" class="evidence-link">[e183.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-202.html#e202.0" class="evidence-link">[e202.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-151.html#e151.0" class="evidence-link">[e151.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental review: PAHs from coal combustion produce DNA adducts leading specifically to G>T transversions; indoor coal burning, household fuel use, and regional air pollution discussed as plausible mechanistic contributors. <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.3" class="evidence-link">[e183.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-175.html#e175.2" class="evidence-link">[e175.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-165.html#e165.3" class="evidence-link">[e165.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Coal/PAH exposures identified as regionally concentrated mutagens; IARC classifies outdoor air pollution (with PAHs) as carcinogenic to humans. Cited experimental mutagenicity studies and prior Xuanwei reports confirm the environmental impact. <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.3" class="evidence-link">[e183.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-175.html#e175.2" class="evidence-link">[e175.2]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Whereas prior literature recognized environment-related carcinogenesis or reported descriptive mutation frequencies, this statement formulates a predictive, falsifiable law directly connecting exposure, spectrum, and mutational signature (both in drivers and TP53). This goes beyond observation and enables environmental attribution via sequencing.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Coal/PAH mutagenesis and their association with lung cancer risk, as well as characteristic mutational signatures (e.g., G>T transversions) are established in environmental epidemiology. Some prior work described regional hotspots of uncommon EGFR mutations in specific Chinese regions.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law explicitly links regional environmental mutagen exposure to a quantifiable, reproducible shift in EGFR exon-specific mutation frequencies (notably exon 18/20 enrichment) and defines this as a molecular 'environmental fingerprint'—identifiable in both driver and TP53 genes—and proposes it as a tool for population/exposure biomarker studies.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In prospective or retrospective cohort studies, other human populations with chronic high PAH/coal exposure (e.g., rural China outside Yunnan, heavily coal-exposed regions in Eastern Europe or India) will demonstrate similar enrichment of EGFR G719X/S768I and higher G>T transversions in EGFR/TP53 among lung cancer cases compared to matched low-exposure controls.</li>
                <li>Regional or household-level intervention programs (e.g., stove upgrades, removal of coal as primary fuel source) implemented in coal-exposed communities will, after a latency, reduce the fraction of new lung cancers with uncommon (exon 18/20) EGFR mutations relative to the baseline period.</li>
                <li>Individuals with biochemically measurable PAH-DNA adducts in airway tissues (or surrogate biosamples) will have lung tumors with higher prevalence of G719X/S768I EGFR mutations and G>T/T>G transversions than individuals without such adducts, even after controlling for ancestry and tobacco use.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a high-PAH-exposure population of non-East Asian ancestry (e.g., Eastern European, African) is studied, it is unknown whether the environmental spectrum shift would override the underlying genetic background, or if the gene-environment interaction is modulated by ancestry.</li>
                <li>The application of whole-exome or genome sequencing to lung cancers from industrial pollution hotspots (non-coal, e.g., petrochemical or diesel exhaust) may or may not reveal analogous infrequent driver enrichment; result will clarify mutagen specificity.</li>
                <li>The frequency of G719X/S768I in a given time and region could be used as a proxy to track historical shifts in coal use and environmental remediation impact—in settings with known chronological exposure data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that EGFR mutational spectra (exon 19/21 dominance) are identical in regions/individuals with and without chronic coal/PAH exposure, controlling for ancestry and tobacco, would strongly contradict the stated law.</li>
                <li>Repeated absence of increased G>T/T>G transversions in EGFR or TP53 in cancers from high-exposure populations would undermine the mutagenic mechanism specified.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating no association between household or personal PAH exposure levels and uncommon EGFR mutation frequency (after rigorous exposure ascertainment) would refute the exposure–mutation spectrum linkage.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Whether underlying germline susceptibility alleles for EGFR-mutant lung cancer modulate or interact with the environmental spectrum shift is not resolved—e.g., whether PAH/coal exposure amplifies, diminishes, or is additive to germline risk (e.g., TERT, FOXP4, HLA-DPB1). <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.0" class="evidence-link">[e161.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.1" class="evidence-link">[e161.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.2" class="evidence-link">[e161.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-148.html#e148.1" class="evidence-link">[e148.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Not all coal/PAH-exposed populations have been molecularly profiled; thus, population-wide generalizability remains to be established. </li>
