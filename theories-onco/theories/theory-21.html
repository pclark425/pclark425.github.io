                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Detection and Ascertainment Bias Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why EGFR activating mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 in lung cancer are more common in patients of East Asian descent compared to other populations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A substantial portion of apparent ethnic differences in EGFR mutation prevalence is artifactual, resulting from systematic differences in testing practices, methodological heterogeneity, and population selection biases across studies and regions. East Asian populations have higher testing rates, greater use of sensitive detection methods (NGS vs PCR vs sequencing), and testing protocols that preferentially include adenocarcinoma and never-smokers. Studies from Asia are more likely to be conducted in specialized cancer centers with advanced molecular diagnostics and to include patients pre-selected for EGFR testing based on clinical characteristics. Western populations historically had lower testing rates and used less sensitive methods, potentially missing mutations. Additionally, publication bias may favor reporting of high-prevalence Asian cohorts. True ethnic differences exist but are smaller than reported differences would suggest.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Methodological Heterogeneity Hypothesis</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Differences in mutation detection methods (direct sequencing vs PCR-based assays vs NGS) produce systematic differences in reported EGFR prevalence, with more sensitive methods used more commonly in Asian studies detecting more mutations. Detection sensitivity differences can account for ~5-10 percentage points of apparent prevalence differences.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to cross-study comparisons using different methodologies; particularly relevant to older studies using direct sequencing (lower sensitivity) vs newer studies using ARMS or NGS.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect is most pronounced for low-frequency mutations and mixed tumor samples</li>
                <li>NGS detects more rare variants than targeted assays</li>
                <li>Plasma/liquid biopsy has different sensitivity than tissue biopsy</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While methodological issues are acknowledged, the theory's emphasis on this as a major contributor to ethnic differences (rather than a minor technical issue) represents a stronger claim than typically made.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The impact of detection method sensitivity on mutation detection rates is well-known in molecular diagnostics, and methodological heterogeneity is commonly cited as a limitation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific proposal that systematic differences in methodology between Asian and Western studies contribute substantially (~5-10 percentage points) to apparent ethnic differences in EGFR prevalence is underemphasized in most discussions.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Population Selection and Enrichment Bias</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Studies from different regions have systematic differences in patient selection criteria, with Asian studies more likely to enrich for clinical characteristics associated with EGFR mutations (adenocarcinoma histology, never-smokers, females, advanced stage requiring molecular testing). Western studies include more unselected populations. Selection bias can account for ~10-15 percentage points of apparent differences.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to cross-study comparisons with different inclusion criteria and sampling strategies; particularly relevant to single-center vs population-based studies.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect is larger for studies explicitly selecting for clinical features vs unselected screening</li>
                <li>Temporal changes in testing guidelines affect selection bias over time</li>
                <li>Referral bias to specialty centers may enhance enrichment</li>

    <li>IPASS trial (East Asian, enriched for non-/light-smokers, 80% female) showed ~60% EGFR prevalence; selection/enrichment of trial population noted as contributing to high rate <a href="../results/extraction-result-320.html#e320.1" class="evidence-link">[e320.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Indian studies note clinical selection (majority adenocarcinoma, mostly non-smokers) and small sample size likely overestimate population prevalence <a href="../results/extraction-result-346.html#e346.0" class="evidence-link">[e346.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-346.html#e346.2" class="evidence-link">[e346.2]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Selection bias is a standard concern, but the theory's specific quantitative claim and proposal that it systematically differs between Asian and Western studies represents a stronger emphasis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Selection bias and referral patterns are standard concerns in epidemiology, and enrichment for clinical characteristics is commonly acknowledged in EGFR studies.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The quantitative claim that selection biases contribute ~10-15 percentage points to apparent ethnic differences and the systematic nature of this bias (Asian studies more enriched) is more explicit than typical discussions.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Differential Testing Access and Implementation</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Healthcare access, availability of molecular testing, and implementation of testing guidelines differ systematically between regions. Asian countries implemented routine EGFR testing earlier and more broadly, while Western countries had more restricted testing. Regions with limited testing infrastructure have apparent lower prevalence due to underdiagnosis rather than true lower mutation rates.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to comparisons across healthcare systems with different testing availability and guidelines; temporal trends as guidelines change.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect is most pronounced in resource-limited settings</li>
                <li>Changes over time as testing becomes more widely available</li>
                <li>May interact with reimbursement policies for testing and targeted therapies</li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While healthcare access issues are known, the theory's focus on this as a systematic bias affecting ethnic prevalence comparisons (not just missing data) is a less common framing.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Healthcare disparities and differential access to molecular testing are well-recognized issues in global oncology.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific proposal that systematic differences in testing implementation between Asian and Western healthcare systems contribute to apparent EGFR prevalence differences (rather than just missing data) is less commonly emphasized.</p>

            <h3>Statement 3: Publication and Reporting Bias</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Studies reporting higher EGFR prevalence rates (particularly from Asia) are more likely to be published and cited, while studies with lower rates or null findings are underrepresented. Meta-analyses may overestimate true prevalence differences due to publication bias favoring positive/interesting findings.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to literature-level prevalence estimates derived from published studies; may affect meta-analyses and systematic reviews.</p>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>As NGS becomes standard worldwide, reported ethnic differences in EGFR prevalence should narrow by ~5-10 percentage points compared to older studies using heterogeneous methods.</li>
                <li>Population-based cancer registries with universal testing (when implemented in multiple countries) should show smaller ethnic differences than clinic-based studies.</li>
                <li>Studies using identical protocols and methods across multiple ethnic populations (e.g., international consortia) should report smaller ethnic differences than meta-analyses of heterogeneous studies.</li>
                <li>Liquid biopsy studies (using consistent methodology) should show more similar prevalence across ethnicities than tissue-based studies using varied methods.</li>
                <li>Pre-registration of molecular epidemiology studies should reduce apparent ethnic differences by reducing publication bias.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If all historical studies were repeated with current standardized NGS protocols and unselected populations, the ethnic gradient might shrink substantially or even reverse for some comparisons.</li>
                <li>Complete data from unpublished studies and registries might reveal that some ethnic differences are artifacts of selective reporting.</li>
                <li>Prospective, population-based molecular epidemiology with standardized methods might show that genetic ancestry effects are negligible after controlling for exposures and methods.</li>
                <li>Machine learning approaches to detect and correct for methodological biases in published literature might substantially revise ethnic prevalence estimates.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Large studies using identical methods across populations showing persistent large ethnic differences would challenge the sufficiency of the detection bias theory.</li>
                <li>Finding that population-based registries with universal testing show similar ethnic gradients to clinic-based studies would suggest biases are not the main explanation.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that methodological variables (sequencing method, selection criteria) do not predict prevalence differences in meta-regression would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Studies showing no publication bias in EGFR mutation prevalence literature (via funnel plots, fail-safe N, etc.) would weaken this explanation.</li>
                <li>Historical studies using consistent methods across time showing widening (not narrowing) ethnic differences as methods improved would challenge the detection bias hypothesis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Within-region ethnic differences using the same methods and populations still show large effects, which cannot be explained by detection bias <a href="../results/extraction-result-300.html#e300.0" class="evidence-link">[e300.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-334.html#e334.0" class="evidence-link">[e334.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Some small high-quality studies with rigorous methods still show large ethnic differences <a href="../results/extraction-result-298.html#e298.0" class="evidence-link">[e298.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-352.html#e352.0" class="evidence-link">[e352.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Biological plausibility of some ethnic differences (e.g., smoking patterns) is independent of detection issues <a href="../results/extraction-result-348.html#e348.0" class="evidence-link">[e348.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-352.html#e352.0" class="evidence-link">[e352.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain why certain mutation types (e.g., exon 19 vs 21 ratios) differ ethnically <a href="../results/extraction-result-300.html#e300.0" class="evidence-link">[e300.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-331.html#e331.0" class="evidence-link">[e331.0]</a> </li>
