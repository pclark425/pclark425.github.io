                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Ascertainment–measurement amplification: testing practices and assay scope inflate apparent East Asian EGFR excess and shape mutation spectra</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why activating EGFR mutations in lung cancer are more common in East Asian populations, and how this relates to responsiveness to EGFR kinase inhibitors, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A substantial share of the historically reported East Asian > Western difference in EGFR-mutant lung cancer prevalence, and some differences in observed mutation spectra, are amplified by how and whom we test and by the breadth of assays used. Three mechanisms contribute: (1) optional or selective testing that preferentially captures patients with high pretest probability (never-smoking adenocarcinoma, common in East Asian cohorts) while many others remain untested or unevaluable; (2) small diagnostic specimens with low evaluability; and (3) narrow hotspot platforms (e.g., ARMS-PCR or limited Sanger of exons 19/21 or 18–21) that miss uncommon and compound EGFR alleles detectable by broad, deep NGS. These practices raise the measured fraction of EGFR-positive cases in tested East Asian cohorts and bias subtype distributions toward classical alleles, while undercounting rare/compound variants. However, across ancestries, EGFR mutation status—not ethnicity—predicts benefit from EGFR-TKIs; empiric TKIs without genotyping can harm EGFR-negative patients, including in East Asia.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Narrow hotspot assays under-detect rare/compound EGFR mutations; NGS increases detection</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> ARMS-PCR and limited exon-targeted Sanger assays can miss rare or compound EGFR variants (and low-VAF alleles), whereas broad NGS panels detect them, thereby increasing the measured prevalence of EGFR-altered tumors and reclassifying some ARMS/Sanger-negative cases as positive.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Clinical molecular testing for EGFR in NSCLC across ancestries; most applicable when testing is restricted to classical hotspots (e.g., exons 19/21) or limited to exons 18–21 via Sanger/ARMS, and when tumor purity or VAF is modest; less pronounced where comprehensive, deep NGS (DNA±RNA) is routine.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For classic exon 19 deletions and L858R, ARMS can be highly sensitive; the under-detection bias is largest for uncommon missense, exon 20 insertions, and compound alleles.</li>
                <li>Very low tumor purity or low-VAF subclones can evade detection even for classical mutations by low-sensitivity platforms (e.g., Sanger).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Direct demonstration that ARMS-PCR failed to detect a rare compound L833V/H835L that a 425-gene NGS panel identified; authors discuss ARMS limitations and NGS breadth/sensitivity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.3" class="evidence-link">[e411.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Compound EGFR mutations represent ~4–14% of EGFR-mutant tumors and are often under-detected without NGS; rare/compound combinations are common patterns. <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.2" class="evidence-link">[e411.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Reviews emphasize that uncommon variants comprise ~10–15% of EGFR mutations overall and that limited-scope assays may miss them. <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.1" class="evidence-link">[e411.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-393.html#e393.0" class="evidence-link">[e393.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple cohorts used ARMS-PCR or targeted Sanger limited to exons 18–21 or only 19/21 (China 2023; China 2018; Pakistan 2024), constraining detection of uncommon/compound events. <a href="../results/extraction-result-380.html#e380.0" class="evidence-link">[e380.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-382.html#e382.0" class="evidence-link">[e382.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-381.html#e381.0" class="evidence-link">[e381.0]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Assay-performance differences are established; using them as a primary explanatory factor for cross-regional epidemiology is a synthetic inference across studies.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is well-known that broad NGS detects more and rarer variants than targeted ARMS/Sanger assays.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Asserting that this detection gap systematically amplifies inter-regional prevalence differences and distorts subtype spectra reported for East Asian vs Western cohorts.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Optional/retrospective testing and small biopsies enriched tested East Asian cohorts for EGFR-positive cases</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In several East Asian trials/care settings, EGFR testing was optional or retrospective and many biopsies were too small for analysis, so the tested/evaluable subset was enriched for patients with higher prior probability of EGFR positivity (e.g., never-smoking adenocarcinoma), inflating observed mutation fractions among those with results.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Clinical trials and hospital series in which molecular testing is non-reflexive, retrospective, or limited by tissue adequacy; most evident in never-smoker East Asian trial cohorts with incomplete testing; attenuated when universal reflex testing with high evaluability is implemented.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Universal reflex testing with adequate tissue (or plasma-first approaches) reduces this enrichment bias.</li>
                <li>Western centers with historically lower testing rates may show the opposite artifact (under-ascertainment), exaggerating regional differences.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>East Asian phase 3 (never-smokers): only 74/236 had evaluable EGFR testing; 68% of those were EGFR-positive, while most biopsies were too small for testing. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.2" class="evidence-link">[e409.2]</a> </li>
    <li>East Asian phase 2 (never-smokers): fewer than 25% provided samples; ~20% were unevaluable; among the tested East Asian subgroup 61% were EGFR-positive. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.1" class="evidence-link">[e409.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Narrative review explicitly highlights optional/retrospective testing, low tissue submission, and high unevaluable rates as sources of bias in reported EGFR prevalence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.0" class="evidence-link">[e409.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Extends known methodological caveats to reinterpret cross-regional prevalence differences.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Selection and tissue-adequacy biases are recognized in EGFR testing literature.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Attributing a measurable portion of the East Asian > Western prevalence gap to these ascertainment artifacts and predicting convergence with reflex testing.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: EGFR-TKI benefit is mutation-driven across ancestries; empiric TKIs in EGFR-unknown East Asians can harm EGFR-negative patients</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Response and PFS benefits from EGFR-TKIs accrue to EGFR-mutant tumors irrespective of patient ancestry; empiric TKI use in ungenotyped East Asian patients risks inferior outcomes for EGFR-negative cases compared with chemotherapy-first strategies.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> First-line selection in advanced NSCLC when EGFR status is unknown or pending; applies across ancestries and histologies where EGFR mutations are actionable; exceptions include severe chemo contraindications or urgent need to bridge until results.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Liquid-biopsy-first strategies can mitigate delays when tissue is limited.</li>
                <li>When classical sensitizing mutations are confirmed, TKIs benefit patients across ethnicities, as shown in Asian and Western trials.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Review and East Asian trial subgroup: EGFR-negative patients had markedly shorter PFS on gefitinib than on chemotherapy followed by gefitinib maintenance; mutation status—not ethnicity—predicted benefit. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.0" class="evidence-link">[e409.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.2" class="evidence-link">[e409.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Randomized trials in Asian and Western cohorts show benefit of TKIs over chemotherapy in EGFR-mutant tumors without ethnicity-specific attenuation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-393.html#e393.0" class="evidence-link">[e393.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In a Korean advanced NSCLC cohort, TKI response was 90% in EGFR-mutant vs 9% in wild-type, underscoring mutation-driven benefit. <a href="../results/extraction-result-370.html#e370.0" class="evidence-link">[e370.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Among Korean male smokers with squamous histology, all EGFR-mutant patients (3/3) responded to gefitinib while only 1/17 wild-type responded, further illustrating mutation-driven benefit across histologies/contexts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-377.html#e377.0" class="evidence-link">[e377.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Clinical principle is established; its deployment to counteract ethnicity-driven empiricism within this methodological framework is interpretive.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Guidelines and trials establish that EGFR-TKI benefit depends on mutation status.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Framing this as a corrective against ethnicity-based empiric therapy in East Asia, where ascertainment bias historically encouraged phenotype-driven treatment.</p>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In centers that switch from ARMS-only (exons 19/21) to comprehensive deep NGS, measured EGFR-positive prevalence will increase by uncovering uncommon/compound variants, and compound EGFR mutations will comprise ~4–14% of EGFR-positive cases.</li>
                <li>Re-analysis of archived East Asian trial specimens initially EGFR-negative by hotspot assays will reclassify a non-trivial subset as EGFR-positive (uncommon/compound alleles) using high-depth NGS.</li>
                <li>Prospective universal reflex NGS (with liquid-biopsy rescue for small samples) will reduce the measured East Asian–Western prevalence gap relative to historical estimates derived from selective testing.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The historically cited ~4× East Asian>Western EGFR prevalence difference will shrink to ≤2× when both regions apply universal reflex deep NGS with high evaluability and similar case-mix; if it does not shrink materially, true biological drivers dominate over ascertainment.</li>
                <li>Implementation of reflex NGS in Western community settings will increase uncommon/compound EGFR detection sufficiently to change first-line therapy assignments by >5% in unselected advanced non-squamous NSCLC.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If broad deep NGS in the same specimens does not increase EGFR detection beyond ARMS/Sanger, the assay-scope amplification claim would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If trial cohorts with optional testing do not show higher EGFR positivity among tested vs untested source populations (after matching on phenotype), the selection-enrichment claim would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If universal reflex testing with high evaluability in both regions does not narrow historical East Asian–Western prevalence gaps, ascertainment bias is not a major contributor.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>True biological differences (e.g., hormonal milieu, female predominance, never-smoking adenocarcinoma distributions) that may contribute to East Asian excess independent of testing. <a href="../results/extraction-result-385.html#e385.0" class="evidence-link">[e385.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-389.html#e389.0" class="evidence-link">[e389.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-380.html#e380.0" class="evidence-link">[e380.0]</a> </li>
