Conversely, Pin1 overexpression activates multiple oncogenic pathways (cyclin D1, Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB, p53/p73 regulation), promotes centrosome amplification and genomic instability, and is prevalent in many cancers — thus Pin1 upregulation favors tumorigenesis but may protect neurons from degeneration.</td>
