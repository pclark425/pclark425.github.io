                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A biologically plausible model for understanding how minute synaptic changes in a recurrent network can nevertheless be retrieved by small cues or even manifest themselves as activity patterns that emerge spontaneously is provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Complex patterns of neural activity appear during up-states in the neocortex and sharp waves in the hippocampus, including sequences that resemble those during prior behavioral experience. The mechanisms underlying this replay are not well understood. How can small synaptic footprints engraved by experience control large-scale network activity during memory retrieval and consolidation? We hypothesize that sparse and weak synaptic connectivity between Hebbian assemblies are boosted by pre-existing recurrent connectivity within them. To investigate this idea, we connect sequences of assemblies in randomly connected spiking neuronal networks with a balance of excitation and inhibition. Simulations and analytical calculations show that recurrent connections within assemblies allow for a fast amplification of signals that indeed reduces the required number of inter-assembly connections. Replay can be evoked by small sensory-like cues or emerge spontaneously by activity fluctuations. Global—potentially neuromodulatory—alterations of neuronal excitability can switch between network states that favor retrieval and consolidation. Author Summary Synaptic plasticity is the basis for learning and memory, and many experiments indicate that memories are imprinted in synaptic connections. However, basic mechanisms of how such memories are retrieved and consolidated remain unclear. In particular, how can one-shot learning of a sequence of events achieve a sufficiently strong synaptic footprint to retrieve or replay this sequence? Using both numerical simulations of spiking neural networks and an analytic approach, we provide a biologically plausible model for understanding how minute synaptic changes in a recurrent network can nevertheless be retrieved by small cues or even manifest themselves as activity patterns that emerge spontaneously. We show how the retrieval of exceedingly small changes in the connections across assemblies is robustly facilitated by recurrent connectivity within assemblies. This interaction between recurrent amplification within an assembly and the feed-forward propagation of activity across the network establishes a basis for the retrieval of memories.</p>
