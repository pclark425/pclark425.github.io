                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A multiscale simulation scheme (MultiSCAAL) that bridges the gap between all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation and coarse-grained molecular simulation that enhances the sampling efficiency of proteins solvated by explicit water molecules and is a promising and effective sampling scheme for investigating chemical interference.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We developed a multiscale approach (MultiSCAAL) that integrates the potential of mean force obtained from all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with a knowledge-based energy function for coarse-grained molecular simulations in better exploring the energy landscape of a small protein under chemical interference such as chemical denaturation. An excessive amount of water molecules in all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations often negatively impacts the sampling efficiency of some advanced sampling techniques such as the replica exchange method and it makes the investigation of chemical interferences on protein dynamics difficult. Thus, there is a need to develop an effective strategy that focuses on sampling structural changes in protein conformations rather than solvent molecule fluctuations. In this work, we address this issue by devising a multiscale simulation scheme (MultiSCAAL) that bridges the gap between all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation and coarse-grained molecular simulation. The two key features of this scheme are the Boltzmann inversion and a protein atomistic reconstruction method we previously developed (SCAAL). Using MultiSCAAL, we were able to enhance the sampling efficiency of proteins solvated by explicit water molecules. Our method has been tested on the folding energy landscape of a small protein Trp-cage with explicit solvent under 8M urea using both the all-atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics and MultiSCAAL. We compared computational analyses on ensemble conformations of Trp-cage with its available experimental NOE distances. The analysis demonstrated that conformations explored by MultiSCAAL better agree with the ones probed in the experiments because it can effectively capture the changes in side-chain orientations that can flip out of the hydrophobic pocket in the presence of urea and water molecules. In this regard, MultiSCAAL is a promising and effective sampling scheme for investigating chemical interference which presents a great challenge when modeling protein interactions in vivo.</p>
