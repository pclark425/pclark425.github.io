Mechanistically in cancer cells, PARK2 mutations reduce E3 ligase activity, impair ubiquitination of cyclin E, cause cyclin E deregulation and mitotic instability, promoting oncogenesis. Thus, the same gene's loss can predispose to neurodegeneration in post-mitotic neurons but to increased proliferation/aneuploidy in dividing cells when somatically inactivated.</td>
