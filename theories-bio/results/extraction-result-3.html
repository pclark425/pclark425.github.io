In each iteration a subset of bank conformations (seeds) is selected (preferring diversity); each seed is modified by replacing contiguous segments of its variables (torsions/angles) with corresponding segments from other bank members or the initial bank to produce trial conformations. Each trial is locally energy-minimized independently (highly parallelizable). For each trial α, the algorithm finds the closest bank conformation A using a distance metric D (sum of absolute differences of variable angles). If D_{αA} < D_cut (current similarity threshold), α replaces A only if its energy is lower; if D_{αA} > D_cut and α's energy is lower than the highest-energy bank member B, α replaces B. The search is progressive: D_cut is initialized large to cover conformational space, then gradually reduced (annealed) so the search narrows to low-energy regions. Rounds repeat until seeds exhausted; additional random minimized conformations can be injected if needed.</td>
