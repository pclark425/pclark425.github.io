                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide and there are currently no cures. Two types of common neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) have become powerful tools to elucidate the inherent complexity and dynamics of the central nervous system at cellular resolution. This technology has allowed the identification of cell types and states, providing new insights into cellular susceptibilities and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative conditions. Exciting research using high throughput scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq technologies to study AD and PD is emerging. Herein we review the recent progress in understanding these neurodegenerative diseases using these state-of-the-art technologies. We discuss the fundamental principles and implications of single-cell sequencing of the human brain. Moreover, we review some examples of the computational and analytical tools required to interpret the extensive amount of data generated from these assays. We conclude by highlighting challenges and limitations in the application of these technologies in the study of AD and PD.</p>
