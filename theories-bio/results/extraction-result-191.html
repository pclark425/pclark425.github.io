                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Alzheimer’s disease (AD) concedes as progressive neurodegenerative disorder, the foremost cause of dementia in late adult life. Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular amyloidal protein deposits as the senile plaques characterize it pathologically. Accumulations of Aβ are amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma and in the cerebral blood vessels where it is known as congophilic angiopathy also known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). NFTs formed the paired helical filaments with hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. These NFTs characterized by the neuronal and synaptic loss and some certain distinctive lesions. Various treatments are available for the disease which include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil) and N-methyl D-aspartate receptor antagonist (memantine).1 Traditionally, Alzheimer’s disease considered as disorders in which intensifying loss of neurons and synapses proceeds in distinct anatomical loci, resulting in different phenotypes. The diagnosis of AD is done by evaluating the location, distribution, and abundance of characteristic brain lesions. These neuroimaging techniques are emerging and capable of both quantifying AD-associated cerebral atrophy and detecting amyloid β (Aβ) peptide, phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau), or other β-pleated sheet proteins in the brain while patients are alive, these techniques also help when disease is completely asymptomatic or at early stages of neurodegeneration. Autopsy or biopsy neuropathologic is to be considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of AD and non-AD dementias. The important characteristics feature of the AD brain on is cortical atrophy, commonly it diffuse and fairly commensurate throughout the cerebral hemispheres rather than being prominent in certain lobes or on one side of the brain (as in the case of some fronto-temporal lobar degenerations). Fresh brain weight is usually below the normal range for an adult (1,200-1,400g), though not necessarily so it may be entirely normal and even, rarely, above the upper range of normal. When the fixed brain is sliced, the cortical atrophy (manifest as thinning of the cortical ribbon) is usually accompanied by enlargement of the ventricular system, or hydrocephalus ex-vacuo, and sometimes by shrinkage, atrophy, and/ or pallor of the subcortical white matter. Coronal slices of (fixed) brain from two different patients, one without dementia and one with; the slices are at comparable coronal levels (near the head of the caudate nucleus). Cortical thinning is less prominent.2 Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by a gradual decrease in the cognitive function, which includes a decline in memory, learning capacity of individuals and also thinking capacity and it is significantly increased among people of age 65 years or above. The disease often begins with minor symptoms and ends with severe brain damage or even death. 1%-6% is the premature stage of all Alzheimer’s disease (age <60-65 years) and approximately 60% of premature-stage AD is familial, with 13% appearing to be inherited in an autosomal prevailing manner. The difference between premature-stage familial Alzheimer disease (onset age <60-65 years) and late stage familial Alzheimer disease (onset age >60-65 years) is somewhat erratic.3 Demise of an individual suffering from AD usually results from general starvation, malnutrition, and pneumonia.4 The substantial growth of the disease can be categorized in four different stages. The first stage is the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and shows a range of symptoms (usually amnesia) which does not alter daily life significantly. Between 6 and 25% of people affected with MCI develop AD every year. The later stages of Alzheimer’s disease (mild and moderate AD) are characterized by an augment in cognitive deficits, and a decline in independence, culminating in the patient’s complete dependence on caregivers and a complete deterioration of personality (Severe AD). Alzheimer’s disease is the sixth-leading</p>
