                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The current state of the art on the use of brain organoids from different species and the molecular and cellular insights generated from these studies are reviewed.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Human brain organoids, generated from pluripotent stem cells, have emerged as a promising technique for modeling early stages of human neurodevelopment in controlled laboratory conditions. Although the applications for disease modeling in a dish have become routine, the use of these brain organoids as evolutionary tools is only now getting momentum. Here, we will review the current state of the art on the use of brain organoids from different species and the molecular and cellular insights generated from these studies. Besides, we will discuss how this model might be beneficial for human health and the limitations and future perspectives of this technology.</p>
