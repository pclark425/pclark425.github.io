                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Genomic perturbations due to inaccurate DNA replication, including inappropriate chromosomal segregation often underlie the development of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The incidence of these two diseases increases with age and exhibits an inverse association. Therefore, elderly subjects with cancer exhibit a reduced risk of a neurodegenerative disease, and vice versa. Both of these diseases are associated with aging and share several risk factors. Cells have multiple mechanisms to repair DNA damage and inaccurate replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor suppressor proteins serve a critical role in the DNA damage response, which may result in genomic instability and thus induction of cellular apoptosis. Tumor suppressor genes, such as phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and TP53 reduce genomic susceptibility to cancer by repairing the damaged DNA. In addition, these genes work cooperatively to ensure the inhibition of the development of several types of cancer. PTEN, BRCA1 and TP53 have been recognized as the most frequently deleted and/or mutated genes in various types of human cancer. Recently, tumor suppressor genes have also been shown to be involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The present review summarizes the recent findings of the functions of these tumor suppressors that are associated with genomic stability, and are involved in carcinogenic and neurodegenerative cell signaling. A summary is presented regarding the interactions of these tumor suppressors with their partners which results in transduction of downstream signals. The implications of these functions for cancer and neurodegenerative disease-associated biology are also highlighted.</p>
