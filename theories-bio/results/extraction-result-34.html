                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background Increasing evidence indicates an association between the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cancer development. Despite advances being made by comparisons from epidemiological studies, common pathways and molecular mechanisms, little is known about the identities of the circular RNAs (circRNAs) involved in the development and progression of these two pathologies and their possible correlations. The aim of this study was to explore the circRNA relationship between AD and cancer. Materials and Methods In this investigation, circRNAs that were significantly dysregulated in AD or associated with AD diagnosis, clinical dementia severity, and neuropathological severity, were examined in a large panel of 28 cancer types. On the basis of shared abnormal circRNAs in AD and cancers, we constructed a circRNA-micro RNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA) network by leveraging experimentally identified miRNA-circRNA and miRNA-mRNA interactions from crosslinking-immunoprecipitation sequencing data. Results An inverse correlation of expression pattern was found in acute myeloid leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, and myelofibrosis. CircRNAs associated with AD diagnosis and clinical severity demonstrated negative correlation in more cancer types. Notably, differentially expressed candidate circRNAs in temporal lobe epilepsy were not associated with any cancers. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis suggested the circRNA-regulated genes are significantly associated with interleukin-12-mediated signaling and viral response. CircPICALM, circRTN4 and circMAN2A1 are the hub nodes in the circRNA-miRNA-target network. Conclusion Our results indicated the relevance of inflammation signaling as a common pathogenesis shared by cancer and AD and provided novel insight for therapeutics targeting circRNAs.</p>
