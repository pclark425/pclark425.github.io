                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Statistical Potential Learning from Ensemble Simulations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how proteins can be folded algorithmically and deterministically without using black-box machine learning solutions, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Effective energy functions for protein folding can be systematically derived by optimizing parameters to maximize the thermodynamic stability of native states in training sets, using gradient ascent on the Boltzmann probability computed from generalized-ensemble simulations (e.g., parallel tempering, replica exchange). The theory posits that: (1) native states occupy thermodynamically favored (high Boltzmann weight) regions of conformational space when the potential is correctly parameterized, (2) gradient estimates require sampling both full conformational space and native-restricted ensembles, (3) iterative updates drive parameters toward values that stabilize training natives, and (4) transferability to new sequences requires sufficient diversity in training and appropriate functional forms. This approach directly optimizes thermodynamic stability rather than discriminative metrics like energy gaps.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Thermodynamic Stability Optimization Principle</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Energy function parameters θ can be optimized via gradient ascent on log-likelihood ∆θ = ηβΣᵢ[⟨∇_θE_θ(R,seqᵢ)⟩ - ⟨∇_θE_θ(R,seqᵢ)⟩_{natᵢ}] where the two thermodynamic averages (over full conformation space and native volume) are estimated by generalized-ensemble sampling (parallel tempering, replica exchange). This directly maximizes native-state Boltzmann probability and produces potentials where ~50-70% of training proteins fold to within 3Å RMSD after ~500 updates.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to parameterizable energy functions (force fields) with differentiable terms; demonstrated for reduced protein models (2-4 interaction sites per residue) on small training sets (<100 proteins, <150 residues each).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Requires adequate sampling of both full and native-restricted ensembles - poor sampling yields unreliable gradients</li>
                <li>Native volume definition (structures within 1-2Å RMSD) affects learning dynamics</li>
                <li>Transferability to sequences outside training set depends on training diversity and model capacity</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Statement 1: Trajectory-Based Training Advantage</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Training energy functions on simulated trajectory ensembles (rather than static decoy libraries) enables detection and correction of model pathologies through direct observation of folding behavior, producing potentials with better thermodynamic properties (lower cold-denatured state populations, more accurate heat capacities) even if trained only on near-native trajectories. This approach avoids the limitation that unrelaxed decoys may not sample the actual low-energy conformations the trained potential creates.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to iterative training protocols where simulation can be interleaved with parameter updates; demonstrated for coarse-grained models on proteins <100 residues.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Requires computational resources for trajectory generation during training (can be expensive)</li>
                <li>Training on short near-native trajectories may not explore far-from-native basins adequately</li>
                <li>Balance between exploration (free ensemble) and native-structure signal required</li>
            </ol>

    <li>Trajectory-based training avoids decoy-library limitations: decoys may not sample actual low-energy states the trained potential creates; simulation reveals pathologies <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.10" class="evidence-link">[e11.10]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.11" class="evidence-link">[e11.11]</a> </li>
    <li>Training on simulated ensembles allows iterative refinement to correct systematic errors (e.g., excess helix stability, cold denaturation) <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.0" class="evidence-link">[e11.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Maximum-likelihood force-field calibration from ensembles requires long converged simulations and is viable for small systems <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.12" class="evidence-link">[e11.12]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While contrastive divergence and ensemble-based training exist, the specific application to protein potentials with articulation of advantages over decoy-based training is an incremental advance.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Training on simulation data and contrastive divergence are established in machine learning; maximum-likelihood force-field calibration from ensembles has been explored.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The systematic articulation of trajectory-based training advantages (detecting pathologies, avoiding decoy limitations) for protein folding potentials and demonstration of improved thermodynamic properties represents a methodological insight.</p>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training on diverse sequence sets (>100 proteins across all structural classes) with trajectory-based methods should improve transferability by 30-50% (measured by success rate on held-out test proteins)</li>
                <li>Increasing sampling length for free ensembles from 5000 to 20000 time units should reduce cold-denaturation artifacts and improve heat capacity curve accuracy by 20-30%</li>
                <li>Combining trajectory-based training with fragment error corrections should reduce systematic errors by 40-60% compared to uncorrected potentials</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether trajectory-based training can scale to all-atom force fields (rather than coarse-grained models) with practical computational costs</li>
                <li>Whether training on far-from-native trajectories (rather than just near-native) significantly improves performance or primarily adds noise</li>
                <li>Whether transferability to very different fold types (e.g., training on α-helical proteins, testing on β-sheets) is achievable with this approach</li>
                <li>Whether optimal balance between native-restricted and free ensemble sampling varies systematically with protein size or structural class</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that potentials trained on static decoy libraries perform equivalently to trajectory-based training would question the trajectory advantage principle</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that training on longer far-from-native trajectories degrades rather than improves performance would challenge assumptions about ensemble diversity</li>
                <li>Showing that trained potentials systematically fail to generalize beyond training set structural classes would limit applicability</li>
                <li>Finding that sampling requirements scale exponentially with protein size would make the approach impractical</li>
