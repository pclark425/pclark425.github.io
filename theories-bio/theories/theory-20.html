                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how brain wiring and synaptic rules support learning at multiple temporal scales, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Multi-contact synapses (multiple physical contacts from one presynaptic neuron to one postsynaptic neuron) exhibit cooperative stabilization where contacts within a connection mutually enhance each other's survival and strength. This cooperativity arises because all contacts from the same presynaptic neuron share spike times and the same postsynaptic response, creating correlated activity that drives shared correlation-dependent potentiation. The cooperation provides protection against stochastic pruning and synaptic failures through improved signal-to-noise ratio that scales as √n_j for n_j contacts, achieving ~80% of maximum SNR at ~6 contacts. This creates a bistable system where connections tend toward either zero/few contacts (unstable, transiently pruned) or multiple contacts (typically 4-6, long-lived), solving the reliability-stability tradeoff by using number of contacts rather than continuous weight strength as the stable memory substrate. The mechanism operates across multiple timescales: millisecond-scale transmission reliability, minute-scale correlation integration, and day-to-week-scale structural stability.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Multi-Contact SNR Scaling Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> For synaptic transmission with stochastic failures (probability p_f), signal-to-noise ratio of a multi-contact connection scales as SNR_j = √((1-p_f)/p_f × n_j), where n_j is the number of contacts. For typical cortical failure probability p_f = 0.5, this reduces to SNR_j = √n_j. Approximately 6 contacts achieve ~80% of theoretical maximum SNR, representing an optimal operating point where additional contacts provide diminishing reliability benefits.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to excitatory cortical synapses with stochastic transmission failures, particularly characterized in layer 5 pyramidal neuron connections in somatosensory cortex. Assumes contacts from the same presynaptic neuron have similar release probabilities, independent failure events across contacts within a connection, and that postsynaptic integration is approximately linear within the range of typical contact numbers. Most directly applicable to adult neocortical circuits with established connectivity patterns.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Very high release probabilities (p_f < 0.2) change scaling and reduce SNR benefit of multiplicity</li>
                <li>Very low release probabilities (p_f > 0.8) make even multi-contact connections unreliable</li>
                <li>Correlated failures across contacts (e.g., due to shared presynaptic machinery limitations) would reduce effective SNR gain below √n_j</li>
                <li>Nonlinear dendritic integration (e.g., NMDA spikes, active dendrites) may enhance or reduce effective SNR depending on contact spatial distribution</li>
                <li>Inhibitory synapses formed on dendritic shafts rather than spines may have different failure statistics and contact organization</li>
                <li>During development with higher baseline formation/elimination rates, optimal contact numbers may differ</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Multi-contact SNR formula derived: SNR_j = sqrt((1-p_f)/p_f * n_j), reducing to sqrt(n_j) for p_f=0.5; approximately 6 contacts achieve ~80% of maximum achievable SNR matching the empirical peak in the model's bimodal distribution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-contact connections improve reliability of instantaneous synaptic responses on millisecond scales through reduced variability; this improved SNR feeds into STDP correlation traces (minutes), increasing the likelihood that multi-contact connections are potentiated and survive through pruning over days/weeks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Model shows multiplicity reduces variability of instantaneous postsynaptic activation (ms scales), making postsynaptic activation more reliable; reliability improvements from millisecond-scale transmission feed into minute-scale STDP correlation traces, increasing likelihood of potentiation and survival. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-contact cooperativity creates mechanism for consolidation: instantaneous reliability improvements (ms) increase correlation measures (minutes), biasing weight growth and reducing pruning so multi-contact connections consolidate into long-term stable synapses over days/weeks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Contact multiplicity motif with experimentally matched unimodal distribution of potential contacts produces model bimodal distribution of active contacts (many zeros, peak ~4-6 for connected pairs), supporting the optimal contact number prediction. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Synaptic transmission failures (Bernoulli, p_f = 0.5) implemented in the multi-contact model; failures appear in correlation term via transmitted spike trains, demonstrating the importance of reliability in the cooperativity mechanism. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.0" class="evidence-link">[e85.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While multi-contact reliability is experimentally known and basic SNR scaling principles exist, the specific quantitative law linking transmission failures, STDP dynamics, and long-term structural stability with precise numerical predictions is novel. The theory makes testable predictions about the relationship between failure probability, optimal contact number, and stability that go beyond descriptive accounts.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The concept that multiple release sites and synaptic contacts improve reliability is well-established from quantal analysis, experimental observations of multi-contact synapses in electron microscopy studies, and basic statistics of independent failures.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit √n_j SNR scaling law with specific quantitative predictions about optimal contact numbers (~6 for 80% max SNR with p_f=0.5), the link from millisecond-scale reliability through minute-scale STDP to day-scale stability, and the prediction of this scaling as the mechanism underlying contact number distributions represent novel quantitative theory.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Cooperative Potentiation Mechanism</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Within a multi-contact connection, the correlation trace C_jk of individual contact k depends on both its own weight w_jk and the total connection weight w_j = Σ_k w_jk. Positive dependence of C_jk on w_j creates cooperativity: as some contacts strengthen, they increase correlations that favor strengthening of sibling contacts from the same presynaptic neuron. This operates through shared presynaptic spikes and identical postsynaptic responses creating correlated correlation measures across contacts. Competition arises across different presynaptic neurons through normalization via limited postsynaptic resources (R_post^4 term) and bounded total input.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to STDP-type correlation-based plasticity rules in multi-contact connections where coincidence detection drives potentiation. Most directly applicable to excitatory-to-excitatory connections in cortex where correlation traces integrate pre- and postsynaptic activity. Requires that contacts from the same presynaptic neuron produce temporally correlated postsynaptic responses and that correlation measures are used to drive plasticity.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Nonlinear dendritic integration might alter cooperativity if contacts are spatially distant on different dendritic branches with independent local processing</li>
                <li>Very weak initial contacts (near creation threshold) might not participate effectively in cooperation until strengthened above a minimum level</li>
                <li>Heterogeneous contact properties (different dendritic locations with different cable filtering, different release probabilities) may modulate the strength of cooperativity</li>
                <li>During strong network activity when postsynaptic neurons are near saturation, competition terms may dominate over cooperation</li>
                <li>In connections with very asynchronous release (e.g., some inhibitory connections), shared spike times may not produce strong correlation benefits</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Contact multiplicity cooperation mechanism: the slow correlation trace C_jk depends both on individual contact weight w_jk and total weight w_j = sum_k w_jk; positive dependence of C_jk on w_j yields cooperativity where strengthening some contacts increases correlations favoring sibling contact strengthening, while competition across presynaptic neurons arises via normalization through R_post^4 and limited total input. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Contacts from one presynaptic neuron share presynaptic spikes and the same postsynaptic firing; the slow correlation trace C_jk depends both on individual contact weight w_jk and total weight w_j, creating shared correlation dynamics across sibling contacts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-trace STDP rule with fast pre/post traces (tau=20ms) and slower correlation trace (tau_slow=1min): contact weight evolves according to dw/dt = a2_corr*C_jk - a4_corr*C_jk^2 - a4_post*R_post^4 - alpha*w_jk, where the correlation term C_jk creates cooperation while R_post^4 term provides competition. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.0" class="evidence-link">[e85.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Strong connections typically consist of ≥4-5 contacts; contacts within multi-contact connections have higher individual weights; multi-contact connections show long lifetimes whereas single-contact connections are pruned randomly regardless of weight, demonstrating the protective effect of cooperativity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Single-contact model (without cooperativity) lacks the subgroup of long-lived connections present in the multi-contact model; multi-contact model produces realistic turnover TOR ≈ 0.176/day matching experimental observations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiplicity creates consolidation mechanism: instantaneous reliability improvements increase correlation measures, biasing weight growth and reducing pruning probability, so multi-contact connections consolidate into long-term stable synapses. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Synaptic sampling model shows that activity-dependent likelihood term biases which new spines are stabilized: repeated activity grows medium spines that can then stochastically become large stable spines, consistent with cooperativity creating positive feedback for strengthening. <a href="../results/extraction-result-155.html#e155.0" class="evidence-link">[e155.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-155.html#e155.2" class="evidence-link">[e155.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Cooperative effects manifest from the same fast (ms) spike timing through minute-scale correlation trace to days-long stability; SNR improvements apply to instantaneous responses but influence long-term survival over days/weeks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While cooperativity concepts exist in the literature (dendritic clustering, Hebbian assemblies), this specific correlation-based mechanism for multi-contact cooperation, with its mathematical formulation showing how C_jk depends on w_j, represents a novel computational mechanism with distinct testable predictions about contact dynamics and stability.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Cooperative mechanisms in synaptic plasticity have been proposed in various contexts, including clustered plasticity on dendrites, heterosynaptic cooperation, and cooperative spine formation. The general principle that nearby or related synapses can cooperate is established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific mechanism where cooperativity arises from shared presynaptic spikes creating correlated correlation measures, with explicit mathematical dependence on total connection weight w_j in the correlation trace, represents a novel mechanistic proposal. The quantitative formulation linking this to STDP dynamics and structural stability with specific parameter predictions is new.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Bistable Contact Distribution</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Under multi-contact cooperativity with STDP-like plasticity and ongoing structural turnover, the distribution of active contacts per connection becomes bimodal: connections have either zero or one contact (unstable, high probability of pruning) or multiple contacts (typically peak at 4-6 contacts, stable with long lifetimes). This contrasts with the unimodal distribution of potential contacts and represents an emergent stability threshold where cooperation becomes effective. The bistability arises from positive feedback: small contact numbers provide insufficient reliability benefit, while reaching ~4-6 contacts triggers cooperative stabilization that protects all contacts in the connection.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to cortical excitatory connections under correlation-based plasticity rules (STDP or similar) with multi-contact structure and ongoing structural plasticity (contact formation and elimination). Most clearly observed in adult cortical circuits with relatively stable baseline connectivity. Requires that cooperativity strength is sufficient to overcome stochastic pruning and that formation rates are not so high as to swamp cooperative effects.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Very strong driving input (high activity correlations) might force even single contacts to be stable, reducing bimodality</li>
                <li>Developmental periods with very high formation rates might show different distributions as transient contacts are more numerous</li>
                <li>Connections between neurons with very different activity patterns (low correlation) might not show bistability as even multi-contact connections remain weak</li>
                <li>During critical periods with enhanced plasticity, the threshold for cooperative stabilization may shift</li>
                <li>Inhibitory connections with different structural rules may not show the same bimodal pattern</li>
                <li>In pathological conditions affecting spine dynamics (e.g., after stroke, in Alzheimer's), the bistable distribution may be disrupted</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Multi-contact model produces bimodal distribution of active contacts (many zeros, peak ~4-6 for connected pairs) compared to unimodal distribution of potential contacts; this bimodal pattern emerges from the cooperativity mechanism. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Single-contact model lacks subgroup of long-lived connections that multi-contact model exhibits; approximately 6 contacts achieve ~80% of maximum achievable SNR, matching the empirical peak in the bimodal distribution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-contact connections show long lifetimes whereas single-contact connections are pruned randomly regardless of weight; strong connections typically consist of ≥4-5 contacts, demonstrating the threshold effect. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Model lifetime of connections increases strongly with total weight (figure 3F in source paper); multi-contact cooperativity creates distinct population of stable connections with characteristic contact numbers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Contacts within multi-contact connections have higher individual weights on average compared to single contacts, consistent with cooperative strengthening. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-contact model turnover TOR ≈ 0.176/day matches experimental observations; single-contact model shows different turnover statistics lacking the stable subpopulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Structural plasticity model with stochastic state transitions shows emergence of bistable synaptic distributions where effectual connectivity P_eff increases from anatomical P toward potential P_pot through selective stabilization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-108.html#e108.1" class="evidence-link">[e108.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Spine volume bistability observed: intrinsic fluctuations with activity-dependent drift create bimodal stability where small spines are vulnerable while large spines (corresponding to multi-contact or strong connections) are stable. <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.0" class="evidence-link">[e159.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.1" class="evidence-link">[e159.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Synaptic sampling model predicts bimodal outcomes: random exploration allows some synapses to stochastically stabilize while others remain weak or are eliminated, consistent with contact number bistability. <a href="../results/extraction-result-155.html#e155.0" class="evidence-link">[e155.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While bistability in synapses is a known concept from both experiments and theory, this specific prediction about contact number distributions arising from cooperativity, with the quantitative prediction of peak location (~4-6) based on SNR optimization, represents a testable novel prediction that goes beyond existing bistability models.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Bimodal distributions in synaptic properties have been observed experimentally and predicted by theoretical models of bistable synapses (e.g., for binary memory storage). The concept of all-or-none potentiation and bistable synaptic states exists in the literature.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific prediction that contact number (not just weight) should show bimodality due to cooperativity, with characteristic peak at 4-6 contacts directly linked to the SNR scaling law, is a novel prediction. The mechanistic explanation linking SNR scaling, cooperativity, and structural stability to produce this specific bimodal pattern is new.</p>

            <h3>Statement 3: Multi-Timescale Integration Principle</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Multi-contact cooperativity operates across and integrates three distinct timescales: (1) millisecond-scale synaptic transmission reliability where contact multiplicity reduces response variability; (2) minute-scale correlation integration where improved reliability increases STDP correlation traces, biasing potentiation; and (3) day-to-week-scale structural stability where accumulated correlation bias reduces pruning probability. This timescale integration creates a path from fast physiological reliability to long-term structural memory, with cooperativity acting as the linking mechanism across scales.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to cortical synapses with correlation-based plasticity mechanisms operating on contacts that undergo structural turnover. Requires STDP or similar rules that accumulate fast coincidence information into slower traces, and structural plasticity mechanisms that are sensitive to accumulated correlation signals. Most directly applicable to adult cortical excitatory connections with established multi-contact structure.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>During developmental critical periods, timescale relationships may differ with faster structural turnover</li>
                <li>In conditions with disrupted homeostatic mechanisms, the integration across timescales may become unstable</li>
                <li>Very slow or very fast activity patterns relative to STDP windows may decouple some timescales</li>
                <li>Acute perturbations (e.g., sensory deprivation) may temporarily decouple fast reliability from long-term stability</li>
                <li>In dendrites with strong nonlinear integration, the simple transmission-reliability → correlation → stability pathway may be modified</li>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Multiplicity reduces variability of instantaneous synaptic responses (instant SNR ~ sqrt(n_j * (1-p_f)/p_f)), making postsynaptic activation more reliable on ms scales; this improved reliability feeds into STDP correlation traces (minutes), increasing likelihood that multi-contact connections are potentiated and survive through pruning over days/weeks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Cooperative effects manifest from the same fast (ms) spike timing through the minute-scale correlation trace to days-long stability; SNR improvements apply to instantaneous postsynaptic responses (ms-to-seconds) but influence long-term survival over days/weeks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-trace STDP with fast pre/post traces (tau=20ms) feeding into slower correlation trace (tau_slow=1min) that drives weight evolution; weight dynamics on seconds-minutes scale interact with structural events (creation/pruning) on day scale. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.0" class="evidence-link">[e85.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiplicity creates mechanism for consolidation: instantaneous reliability improvements (ms) increase correlation measures (minutes), biasing weight growth and reducing pruning so multi-contact connections consolidate into long-term stable synapses over days/weeks, explicitly linking all three timescales. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Fast spike-timing updates (ms) accumulate slowly via small learning rates into mean synaptic drift over seconds-minutes to reach stable distributions; the rule links millisecond-scale spike timing to long-term synaptic reconfiguration over seconds-hours. <a href="../results/extraction-result-112.html#e112.0" class="evidence-link">[e112.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While multi-timescale plasticity is recognized, this specific mechanistic integration where cooperativity creates a causal chain from fast reliability to long-term stability, with explicit mathematical relationships at each stage, provides novel mechanistic insight beyond general acknowledgment of multiple timescales.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Multi-timescale processes in synaptic plasticity are widely recognized, including fast STDP, intermediate homeostatic processes, and slow structural changes. The general principle that processes at different timescales interact is established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific mechanistic pathway from millisecond transmission reliability through minute-scale correlation integration to day-scale structural stability, with cooperativity as the explicit linking mechanism across all three timescales, represents a novel unified framework. The quantitative predictions about how reliability improvements (SNR) directly translate to stability via correlation traces is new.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Experimentally forcing synapse formation between two neurons but limiting connectivity to single contacts (e.g., through spatial constraints, genetic manipulation limiting spine density, or targeted elimination of nascent contacts) should result in unstable connections with high turnover rates comparable to the model's ~0.176/day baseline, while allowing multi-contact formation should produce stable connections with significantly extended lifetimes (weeks to months).</li>
                <li>Selective deletion of contacts from established multi-contact connections should reduce stability more than proportional to the number deleted: removing contacts from a 6-contact connection down to 3 should cause rapid decay of remaining contacts within days, while removing 2 contacts from 8 should have minimal effect on stability, demonstrating the cooperative threshold effect predicted by the theory.</li>
                <li>Manipulating failure probability (e.g., through Ca2+ buffering, changes in release probability via presynaptic receptors, or vesicle pool size manipulation) should shift the optimal contact number: increasing p_f from 0.5 to 0.7 should shift the peak in the contact distribution from ~6 to ~8-9 contacts (as predicted by SNR_j = √((1-p_f)/p_f × n_j)).</li>
                <li>Correlation between contact number and connection lifetime should be strongest and most nonlinear in the 1-6 contact range (with steep increase in stability) and saturate beyond ~6-8 contacts as predicted by the SNR saturation curve, testable through long-term in vivo two-photon imaging of dendritic spines.</li>
                <li>Simultaneous manipulation of multiple contacts from the same presynaptic neuron (e.g., local optogenetic strengthening or weakening) should affect all contacts cooperatively: strengthening one contact should increase the growth rate of sibling contacts compared to strengthening contacts from different presynaptic neurons, directly testing the shared correlation hypothesis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether cooperativity operates similarly in inhibitory synapses (formed on dendritic shafts rather than spines, potentially with different contact organization and plasticity rules) is unknown but testable through high-resolution EM reconstruction combined with functional imaging; if cooperativity is a general principle, inhibitory connections should also show multi-contact structure and bistable distributions, though the optimal numbers may differ.</li>
                <li>Whether there are regional variations in optimal contact number across different cortical areas (potentially related to local activity statistics, failure probabilities, or computational requirements) remains unexplored; comparing contact distributions between sensory cortex, association cortex, and frontal areas could reveal whether the ~6-contact optimum is universal or functionally tuned.</li>
                <li>Whether multi-contact cooperativity is necessary for long-term memory storage or whether it primarily enhances reliability and stability of existing memories is unclear and distinguishable through careful manipulation: if memory can form normally with single contacts but is more fragile, cooperativity would be a stability mechanism rather than a learning requirement; if multi-contact structure is required for memory formation, it would be an essential learning mechanism.</li>
                <li>How cooperativity interacts with different forms of synaptic plasticity (e.g., spike-timing-dependent vs. voltage-dependent vs. behavioral-timescale plasticity) is unknown; whether cooperativity amplifies or constrains the expression of different plasticity rules could reveal fundamental constraints on learning mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal contact number and cooperativity strength change across development, aging, or experience-dependent plasticity regimes is unknown but has major implications for understanding critical periods, learning capacity across lifespan, and potential therapeutic interventions.</li>
                <li>How cooperativity is modulated by neuromodulators (dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin) that are known to affect plasticity is unexplored; if neuromodulators can shift the cooperative threshold or SNR scaling, this would provide a mechanism for state-dependent tuning of synaptic stability and could explain some behavioral state effects on learning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding stable, long-lived single-contact connections at frequencies comparable to multi-contact connections (e.g., >50% of connections surviving >30 days with only one contact) would contradict the cooperativity-based stability mechanism and suggest other stability mechanisms dominate.</li>
                <li>Observing SNR that does not scale with √n_j (e.g., finding linear scaling, no scaling, or saturation at low contact numbers like 2-3 rather than ~6) would contradict the statistical SNR law and require revision of the transmission reliability assumptions.</li>
                <li>Finding no correlation between contact number and connection lifetime in longitudinal imaging studies (e.g., if single-contact and multi-contact connections have similar survival probabilities) would undermine the core stability predictions of the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that selective strengthening or weakening of individual contacts within a connection has no effect on sibling contacts (i.e., contacts are independent) would contradict the cooperative potentiation mechanism and suggest correlation measures are purely local.</li>
                <li>Observing unimodal (or uniform) contact distributions rather than bimodal distributions in multiple cortical areas would contradict the bistability prediction and suggest cooperativity is either weak or counteracted by other mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Finding that experimentally eliminating multi-contact connections (e.g., through genetic manipulation preventing multiple spine formation from one presynaptic neuron) has no effect on learning, memory stability, or synaptic transmission reliability would suggest cooperativity is not functionally important despite its structural presence.</li>
                <li>Showing that failure probability manipulations (changing p_f) do not affect contact distributions or stability as predicted by the SNR formula would indicate the reliability-stability link is not direct or that other compensatory mechanisms exist.</li>
            </ol>
