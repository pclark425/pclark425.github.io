                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of which brain cell types are most susceptible and most resilient in Alzheimer's disease and why, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A genetically primed glial–vascular amplification module composed of microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and endothelia escalates with Alzheimer pathology and amplifies neuronal injury through inflammation, matrix remodeling, and vascular dysfunction. AD genetic risk concentrates in microglial/oligodendrocyte modules. APOE ε2 constrains this multi-lineage phenotypic shift and is associated with lower aggregated tau (MTBR), conferring organismal resilience even at end-stage when plaques have plateaued.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: AD genetic risk concentrates in glial modules that scale with pathology</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Co-expression modules enriched for microglial and oligodendrocyte/myelin proteins are over-represented for AD GWAS genes and increase with amyloid/tau burden and clinical status, whereas neuronal modules lack similar AD-GWAS enrichment and tend to decrease.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Human postmortem cortex (frontal/precuneus; DLPFC) proteome and transcriptome module analyses in late-onset AD across control, AsymAD, and AD; module-level GWAS enrichment derived with MAGMA.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Some inflammatory/extracellular modules are shared across neurodegenerative diseases (non-AD-specific).</li>
                <li>Oligodendrocyte myelin module (B-M2) shows strong GWAS enrichment but its directional change is less emphasized proteomically.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Astrocyte/inflammatory and ECM glial modules (B-M6 and B-M5) increase in AsymAD/AD, correlate with CERAD/Braak, and are enriched for AD GWAS genes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-201.html#e201.1" class="evidence-link">[e201.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Microglia-enriched protein and transcript modules increased in AD and strongly correlate with tangle pathology and cognitive decline; AD GWAS candidates map to microglial modules. <a href="../results/extraction-result-201.html#e201.2" class="evidence-link">[e201.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Oligodendrocyte/myelin module (B-M2) and transcriptome oligodendrocyte module (T-M13) over-represent AD GWAS candidates including BIN1 and PICALM. <a href="../results/extraction-result-201.html#e201.3" class="evidence-link">[e201.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Non-neuronal glia (astrocyte, microglia) show largest transcriptional dysregulation in EC snRNA-seq. <a href="../results/extraction-result-193.html#e193.4" class="evidence-link">[e193.4]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Integrates GWAS, modules, and scaling with pathology into a single systems mechanism.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> AD GWAS implicates microglial/immune and some myelin genes; glial modules are known to correlate with pathology.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Asserting a systems-level claim that genetic risk concentrates within glial modules that actively scale with pathology, positioning these as the amplification layer in disease.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: APOE ε2 constrains glial/endothelial phenotypes and tau aggregate burden</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In AD cortex, APOE ε2/3 suppresses both homeostatic and disease-associated phenotypic shifts in astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and endothelia and is accompanied by lower MTBR tau burden versus ε4/4, despite similar end-stage amyloid load.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Human DLPFC bulk proteomics with deconvolution and module analyses stratified by APOE genotype in end-stage AD; tau MTBR peptide quantification by LC-MS/MS.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>At end-stage, ε3/3 and ε4/4 may look similar for some cellular phenotypes due to plateau effects.</li>
                <li>Suppression denotes phenotypic program attenuation, not necessarily absolute cell-number change.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Astrocyte fraction increases with amyloid and tau; both homeostatic and disease-associated astrocyte markers are suppressed in ε2/3 versus ε3/3 AD. <a href="../results/extraction-result-203.html#e203.0" class="evidence-link">[e203.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Microglial phenotypic marker shifts are suppressed in ε2/3 AD; inflammatory module M4 (containing ApoE) associates with APOE genotype. <a href="../results/extraction-result-203.html#e203.1" class="evidence-link">[e203.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Endothelial estimated fraction elevated in AD ε3/3 and ε4/4 but prevented/suppressed in ε2/3. <a href="../results/extraction-result-203.html#e203.3" class="evidence-link">[e203.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Oligodendrocyte phenotypic marker changes suppressed in ε2/3 AD. <a href="../results/extraction-result-203.html#e203.2" class="evidence-link">[e203.2]</a> </li>
    <li>MTBR tau (aggregated tau) is significantly lower in ε2/3 vs ε4/4 and correlates with Braak stage; amyloid similar across genotypes at end-stage. <a href="../results/extraction-result-203.html#e203.5" class="evidence-link">[e203.5]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Adds multi-lineage phenotype suppression and tau aggregation readout to APOE ε2 resilience model.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> APOE isoforms modulate AD risk; ε2 is protective; prior reports link ε2 to lower tau.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Cross-lineage, coordinated suppression of glial and endothelial phenotypes linked quantitatively to lower aggregated tau in the same brains.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Microglial phagocytic set-point genes tune amyloid and neurodegeneration</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Microglial receptors and transporters that set phagocytosis/inflammatory tone (TREM2, CD33, ABCA7) causally modulate amyloid burden and downstream neurodegeneration; risk variants shift this set-point toward impaired clearance and increased pathology.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Human genetic studies (GWAS/rare variants), human brain expression, microglial cell assays, and mouse models focused on microglia-mediated clearance.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>CD33 common variant significance varies by meta-analysis size but functional data support its inhibitory role.</li>
                <li>Effects may depend on APOE lipidation/particle context.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>TREM2 rare variants (e.g., R47H) increase AD risk and associate with greater brain atrophy; TREM2 promotes phagocytosis and modulates inflammation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-205.html#e205.4" class="evidence-link">[e205.4]</a> </li>
    <li>CD33 activation inhibits Aβ phagocytosis; exon-2 skipping variant reduces CD33 function and insoluble Aβ in AD brains; CD33+ microglia correlate with plaques. <a href="../results/extraction-result-205.html#e205.3" class="evidence-link">[e205.3]</a> </li>
    <li>ABCA7 deficiency increases Aβ deposition in APP mice; ABCA7 expression is ~10× higher in microglia than CA1 neurons; ABCA7 SNPs associate with neuritic plaque burden. <a href="../results/extraction-result-205.html#e205.1" class="evidence-link">[e205.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Microglial modules scale with tangles/cognition; disease-associated microglial (DAM-like) states identified in human AD across datasets. <a href="../results/extraction-result-201.html#e201.2" class="evidence-link">[e201.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-193.html#e193.5" class="evidence-link">[e193.5]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Conceptual integration of multiple loci into a control lever for module-level activation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Individual microglial genes (TREM2, CD33, ABCA7) have known roles in AD risk/clearance.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Framing them as a unified ‘set-point’ that upstream-tunes the glial amplification module and thereby shapes amyloid and downstream tau/vascular responses.</p>

            <h3>Statement 3: Astrocytic and endothelial reactivity act as late-stage amplifiers</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Astrocyte and endothelial signatures increase with neurofibrillary burden and disease stage and are suppressed by APOE ε2; these responses amplify neuronal injury via inflammatory and vascular mechanisms rather than representing primary cell loss.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Human frontal/precuneus bulk proteomics across control → AsymAD → AD; APOE-stratified DLPFC proteomes; bulk deconvolution and compositional markers including VLMC.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Astrocyte/inflammatory modules can already rise in AsymAD (early priming).</li>
                <li>VLMC/endothelial increases may partly reflect relative compositional effects due to neuronal loss.</li>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Across cortical regions beyond DLPFC (e.g., MTG, STG), APOE ε2 carriers with AD will show lower glial/endothelial eigenproteins and lower MTBR tau than ε4 carriers at matched Braak stage.</li>
                <li>In human snRNA-seq, ε2 carriers will show fewer CD33-high microglia and reduced DAM-like proportions relative to ε4 carriers, at matched pathology.</li>
                <li>Individuals carrying TREM2/CD33/ABCA7 risk alleles will exhibit higher glial-module eigenproteins and faster cognitive decline at comparable amyloid levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Therapeutic partial CD33 exon-2 skipping in prodromal AD will reduce plaque burden and secondarily reduce regional tau MTBR within two years.</li>
                <li>Endothelial stabilizers that restore BBB integrity in ε4 carriers will downshift astrocyte inflammatory modules and slow tangle propagation across association cortex.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>ε2 carriers fail to show suppressed glial/endothelial phenotypes and lower MTBR tau at matched stage.</li>
                <li>Microglial risk alleles show no association with insoluble Aβ or glial-module activation in human brain cohorts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some oligodendrocyte/myelin module changes (B-M2) lack a consistent directional shift despite strong GWAS enrichment. <a href="../results/extraction-result-201.html#e201.3" class="evidence-link">[e201.3]</a> </li>
