                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the main factors determining the organization of tissues from single cells, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Tissue organization from single cells proceeds through a hierarchical sequence of self-organizing processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales: (1) initial cell aggregation driven by adhesion and motility, (2) symmetry-breaking and regional specification through biochemical patterning mechanisms (reaction-diffusion, lateral inhibition, or wave-pinning), (3) mechanical sorting and spatial refinement driven by differential adhesion and cortical tension, (4) morphogenetic shaping through coordinated cell behaviors (apical constriction, intercalation), and (5) maturation through ECM remodeling and vascularization. Each level constrains and enables the next, with feedback between levels. The dominant mechanisms and their relative importance depend on system size, cell type composition, and boundary conditions.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Scale-Dependent Mechanism Dominance</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The dominant patterning mechanism transitions predictably with tissue size: small aggregates (<100 μm) exhibit polarization/wave-pinning behaviors producing single asymmetric domains; intermediate sizes (100-400 μm) show Turing-like periodic patterns with wavelength scaling; large tissues (>400 μm) require vascularization to overcome diffusion limits and enable continued organization.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to 3D organoid systems derived from pluripotent or progenitor cells in vitro, where cells maintain epithelial or mesenchymal character and can respond to morphogen gradients. Does not apply to purely mesenchymal aggregates without patterning competence or to tissues with pre-established axes from in vivo development.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Neural tube organoids at ~50-100 μm show single FoxA2+ domain formation despite being in a size range that might support periodic patterns, likely due to strong positive feedback in the Shh-FoxA2 circuit.</li>
                <li>Gastruloids at ~200 μm diameter can show multiple T/Bra protrusions in larger aggregates, suggesting onset of periodic patterning above a critical size.</li>
                <li>Micropatterned 2D geometries can override spontaneous size-dependent mechanisms by imposing specific boundary conditions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neural tube organoids (~50-100 μm) show single FoxA2+ floor-plate domain via mutual inhibition and positive feedback, consistent with wave-pinning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.17" class="evidence-link">[e68.17]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.10" class="evidence-link">[e68.10]</a> </li>
    <li>Gastruloids (~200 μm) show size-dependent symmetry: small colonies (R=50-150 μm) produce single off-center T/Bra domains (χ=0.6±0.2), while larger colonies (R>200 μm) show centered patterns (χ=0.2±0.2) and can produce multiple protrusions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.0" class="evidence-link">[e65.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.5" class="evidence-link">[e68.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Cortical organoids (300-400 μm) show rostral-caudal half-and-half polarization, potentially representing half of a Turing wavelength. <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.0" class="evidence-link">[e68.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.11" class="evidence-link">[e68.11]</a> </li>
    <li>Organoids beyond ~4 mm diameter experience central necrosis due to oxygen/nutrient diffusion limits without vascularization; retinal organoids survived ~126 days before central death. <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.13" class="evidence-link">[e59.13]</a> </li>
    <li>Vascularization is necessary for large-size/long-term maturation; lack of vasculature causes hypoxia, necrosis and limited maturation in growing organoids. <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.6" class="evidence-link">[e59.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.13" class="evidence-link">[e59.13]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 1: Adhesion-Polarity Competition Principle</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> When cells with differential adhesive affinity aggregate, initial sorting follows thermodynamic adhesion minimization (more adhesive cells interior), but this pattern can be dynamically reversed by cell-autonomous polarity establishment, which overrides adhesion-based positioning by directing cells with apical-basal polarity to tissue surfaces regardless of adhesive strength. The timescale of polarity establishment relative to mechanical equilibration determines final tissue architecture.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to aggregating epithelial or epithelial-competent cells (ES cells, early embryonic cells) that can establish apical-basal polarity with identifiable apical markers (ZO-1, aPKC) and that express modulated levels of classical cadherins. Most relevant in early embryoid body formation and organoid aggregation phases (first 12-48 hours).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Purely mesenchymal cells without polarity machinery follow adhesion-based sorting without reversal.</li>
                <li>Cells with pre-established stable polarity may not undergo the sorting-to-reversal transition.</li>
                <li>Very rapid polarity establishment (within hours) may prevent initial adhesion-driven sorting from occurring.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>E-cadherin null ES cells initially envelope WT cells (per differential adhesion at 12 hr), but by 48 hr WT E-cadherin+ cells relocate to outer surface forming polarized epithelium, reversing the pattern. <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.0" class="evidence-link">[e60.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.1" class="evidence-link">[e60.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.2" class="evidence-link">[e60.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Actin-cap polarity in undifferentiated ES cell aggregates forms contiguously in E-cadherin-positive surface cells and is mechanistically distinct from later Dab2-dependent endoderm polarity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.2" class="evidence-link">[e60.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.3" class="evidence-link">[e60.3]</a> </li>
    <li>RA-differentiated cells expressing Dab2 establish polarity that can override adhesion-driven positioning, relocating differentiated cells to spheroid surface. <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.3" class="evidence-link">[e60.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.6" class="evidence-link">[e60.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Differential adhesion hypothesis predicts sorting based on adhesive affinity differences, which was observed early but not maintained at later timepoints. <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.1" class="evidence-link">[e60.1]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While adhesion and polarity are both well-studied, the specific temporal dynamics of their competition and the principle of timescale-dependent outcomes synthesizes recent observations into a novel predictive framework.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Differential adhesion hypothesis (Steinberg) and the role of apical-basal polarity in epithelial organization are well-established; competition between adhesion and polarity has been discussed.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit temporal sequence showing initial adhesion-based sorting followed by polarity-driven reversal, with quantitative timing (12 hr adhesion-dominated, 48 hr polarity-dominated), and the principle that polarity establishment timescale relative to mechanical equilibration determines outcome represents a novel mechanistic framework.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: ECM-Mechanical Feedback Loop in Morphogenesis</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Extracellular matrix organization and cell-generated mechanical forces form a bidirectional feedback system that determines regional tissue architecture: cells assemble and remodel ECM (particularly fibronectin-collagen networks) while simultaneously responding to ECM mechanical properties (stiffness, degradability, fibril tension) through mechanotransduction pathways (integrin-YAP, focal adhesions). This feedback produces self-amplifying regional specialization where (1) cells under tension create extended, anchored ECM fibrils that expose cryptic binding sites promoting proliferation, and (2) cells in mechanically relaxed regions maintain compact ECM promoting quiescence or differentiation. ECM degradability and remodeling capacity determine whether morphogenetic movements (branching, tubulogenesis) can proceed.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to tissues where cells can both secrete/assemble ECM (particularly fibronectin, collagens) and exert contractile forces through actomyosin. Most relevant to mesenchymal and epithelial tissues undergoing active morphogenesis in 3D culture or during wound healing. Requires integrin-mediated adhesion and mechanotransduction machinery.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Purely epithelial tissues on rigid substrates may not show ECM remodeling feedback.</li>
                <li>Cells lacking fibronectin or key ECM assembly machinery cannot establish the feedback loop.</li>
                <li>Very stiff or non-degradable matrices prevent cell-mediated remodeling and block feedback.</li>
                <li>2D culture on glass eliminates most 3D ECM remodeling aspects.</li>

            <h3>Statement 3: Boundary Condition Control of Symmetry Breaking</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In confined tissue systems, boundary conditions (geometry, flux parameters at edges, micropatterning) deterministically bias or control symmetry-breaking outcomes by modulating morphogen dynamics and mechanical constraints. Specifically: (1) system radius R relative to morphogen decay length λ (dimensionless Ř=R/λ) determines whether centered or off-center patterns emerge; (2) boundary flux parameters (σ_i) control morphogen accumulation and production domain size; (3) geometric constraints (micropattern shape, mechanical confinement) directly impose spatial biases that reduce stochasticity. Engineering boundary conditions provides a powerful handle to achieve reproducible patterning.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to in vitro organoid and tissue culture systems where physical boundaries are well-defined (micropatterned substrates, hydrogel confinements, microfluidic chambers). Most relevant when morphogen diffusion lengths are comparable to system size. Does not apply to large in vivo tissues where local neighborhoods effectively lack boundaries.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Very large systems (R >> λ) become insensitive to boundary effects and revert to bulk patterning.</li>
                <li>Systems with very small R or extremely short morphogen ranges may not support pattern formation at all.</li>
                <li>Open boundary conditions (high flux) versus closed boundaries produce qualitatively different behaviors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Micropatterned colony radius R controls symmetry: small R (50-150 μm) yields high symmetry scores (χ=0.6±0.2, off-center patterns), large R (>200 μm) yields low χ (0.2±0.2, centered patterns). <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.0" class="evidence-link">[e65.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.8" class="evidence-link">[e65.8]</a> </li>
    <li>Activator-repressor model with boundary flux parameters σ_i and penetration lengths δ_i reproduces experimental size-dependent symmetry when δ_B ∈ [2,4] and λ≈50 μm. <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.3" class="evidence-link">[e65.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.4" class="evidence-link">[e65.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.7" class="evidence-link">[e65.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Micropatterning provides a primary control mechanism enabling precise colony size and geometry, which directly affects pattern emergence through boundary conditions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.2" class="evidence-link">[e65.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Microengineered geometries (micropatterns, tubular cavities) deterministically control crypt/branch positioning by altering cell packing and YAP mechanosensing; geometry was sufficient to drive deterministic patterning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.10" class="evidence-link">[e70.10]</a> </li>
    <li>2D micropattern methods give more robust and reproducible patterns than spontaneous 3D organoids by providing deterministic spatial cues. <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.19" class="evidence-link">[e68.19]</a> </li>
    <li>Initial size, cell density, and colony shape control whether neural plate curling and tube closure occur; altering these parameters prevented successful closure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-66.html#e66.5" class="evidence-link">[e66.5]</a> </li>

            <ol>
                <li>Organoids cultured at intermediate sizes (200-300 μm diameter) should show transitions between single-domain and multi-domain patterning that can be fine-tuned by adjusting confinement geometry.</li>
                <li>Artificially imposing faster polarity establishment (e.g., by overexpressing polarity regulators like aPKC) should reduce or eliminate initial adhesion-based sorting in mixed ES cell aggregates.</li>
                <li>Increasing matrix degradability (more MMP-cleavable sites) in hydrogels should promote more extensive branching and larger organoid size by enabling ECM remodeling feedback.</li>
                <li>Micropatterning with asymmetric geometries (ellipses, crescents) should bias the orientation of symmetry breaking in gastruloids and cortical organoids predictably along the pattern axis.</li>
                <li>Modulating boundary flux parameters (e.g., by coating pattern edges with morphogen-binding molecules) should shift symmetry scores in micropatterned gastruloids.</li>
                <li>Organoids formed in stiff, non-degradable matrices should remain smaller and show reduced regional specialization compared to soft, degradable matrices.</li>
                <li>Increasing oxygen supply (hyperoxygenation or microfluidic perfusion) should extend the maximum size before central necrosis from ~4 mm to larger dimensions.</li>

                <li>Can we extend organoid size indefinitely by combining engineered pre-vascularization (ETV2 expression) with optimized ECM mechanics and microfluidic perfusion, or are there other fundamental limits?</li>
                <li>If boundary conditions are the primary driver of reproducibility, can we create a 'universal' micropatterning geometry that produces robust patterning across multiple organoid types (neural, cardiac, intestinal)?</li>
                <li>Does the adhesion-to-polarity transition occur universally across all epithelial organoid types, or is it specific to ES cells and early embryonic contexts?</li>
                <li>Can we pharmacologically accelerate or decelerate the polarity establishment timescale to precisely control final tissue architecture in a predictable manner?</li>
                <li>At what system size does the transition from Turing-like periodic patterning to wave-pinning single-domain formation occur for different morphogen systems (Wnt/Nodal vs BMP/Noggin vs SHH/FoxA2)?</li>
                <li>If we engineer matrices with spatially-varying stiffness gradients, will organoids self-organize into tissues with predicted regional specialization matching the mechanical gradients?</li>
                <li>Can temporal modulation of boundary conditions (changing R or flux parameters over time) produce complex, multi-stage patterning not achievable with static conditions?</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If organoids at 100-200 μm consistently produce multiple periodic domains rather than single polarized domains, it would challenge the size-dependent mechanism transition principle.</li>
                <li>If polarity-deficient cells (aPKC knockout) still show sorting pattern reversal in ES cell aggregates, it would refute the polarity-override mechanism.</li>
                <li>If blocking ECM assembly (fibronectin knockout) does not affect regional proliferation patterns in conditions with pre-formed matrix, it would challenge the necessity of the ECM feedback loop.</li>
                <li>If randomly-shaped boundaries produce equally reproducible patterns as geometric micropatterns, it would challenge the importance of boundary condition control.</li>
                <li>If organoids continue growing beyond 4 mm without vascularization in standard culture, it would refute the diffusion-limit scale.</li>
                <li>If matrix stiffness has no effect on organoid patterning in systems with abundant growth factors, it would challenge the ECM-mechanical feedback principle.</li>
                <li>If extremely small organoids (<50 μm) show robust periodic patterning rather than polarization, it would violate the scale-dependent mechanism prediction.</li>

    <li>The specific molecular identities of activator and repressor in gastruloid patterning remain unproven (candidates include Nodal/Lefty, Wnt/Dkk, BMP ligands). <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.11" class="evidence-link">[e65.11]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.5" class="evidence-link">[e68.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.6" class="evidence-link">[e68.6]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of mechanical tissue flows and active cell migration in symmetry breaking is mentioned but not integrated into the hierarchical framework. <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.10" class="evidence-link">[e65.10]</a> </li>
    <li>Gene regulatory network dynamics and transcription factor networks are largely absent from the mechanistic framework. </li>
    <li>The immune system and inflammatory responses are not addressed but affect tissue organization in vivo. </li>
    <li>Metabolic gradients (beyond oxygen/nutrients) and their effects on patterning are not incorporated. </li>
