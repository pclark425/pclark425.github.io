                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why activating EGFR mutations in lung cancer are more common in East Asian populations, and how this relates to responsiveness to EGFR kinase inhibitors, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The higher observed prevalence of activating EGFR mutations in East Asian NSCLC arises from a combination of demography (greater shares of never-smokers, adenocarcinoma histology, and female patients in clinical series) and testing/selection practices (earlier, broader, and more systematic molecular testing; less under-detection of rare/compound variants). Within any ancestry, EGFR status—not ethnicity—determines TKI benefit.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Clinicopathologic composition drives higher EGFR fractions</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> EGFR mutations are enriched in adenocarcinoma, never-smokers, and females; East Asian clinical series contain higher proportions of these groups, inflating the aggregate observed EGFR mutation prevalence.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Hospital-based cohorts of incident NSCLC; applies to prevalence estimates based on consecutively tested cases.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Population-based registries that match clinicopathologic composition across ancestries will show smaller prevalence gaps.</li>
                <li>Within subgroups (e.g., male smokers), EGFR frequencies can still be non-zero (including squamous histology).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>EGFR mutations concentrated in never-smokers, females, and adenocarcinoma in Korean cohort (advanced NSCLC). <a href="../results/extraction-result-370.html#e370.0" class="evidence-link">[e370.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Japanese and Chinese cohorts show high EGFR prevalence, with sex and histology associations; some analyses show smoking not associated in men. <a href="../results/extraction-result-389.html#e389.0" class="evidence-link">[e389.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-382.html#e382.0" class="evidence-link">[e382.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-380.html#e380.0" class="evidence-link">[e380.0]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 1: Testing and selection biases amplify apparent differences</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Optional or retrospective EGFR testing, small/evaluable-tissue fractions, and limited-scope assays (e.g., ARMS panels restricted to exons 19/21) can bias observed prevalence; earlier adoption of broader NGS in East Asian centers reduces under-detection of rare/compound variants and increases measured EGFR frequency.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Clinical trial cohorts and real-world testing programs prior to universal reflex comprehensive NGS; applies to cross-region comparisons when testing strategies differed.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In programs with universal, high-quality NGS and high tissue adequacy, prevalence estimates converge toward true population values.</li>
                <li>Restricting to only common mutations (19del/L858R) undercounts uncommon EGFR alterations and compound variants.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Trials often had optional EGFR testing with low submission and high unevaluable rates; EGFR status available in small subsets. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.0" class="evidence-link">[e409.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.1" class="evidence-link">[e409.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.2" class="evidence-link">[e409.2]</a> </li>
    <li>ARMS-PCR can miss rare/compound variants; NGS detects broader spectrum (case: ARMS-negative, NGS-positive L833V/H835L). <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.3" class="evidence-link">[e411.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Compound mutations comprise 4–14% of EGFR-mutant tumors; under-detected by hotspot assays. <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.2" class="evidence-link">[e411.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.1" class="evidence-link">[e411.1]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Extends recognized measurement bias into a structured explanation for cross-regional differences.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Testing biases and assay limitations have been noted in reviews and case reports.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Arguing that differential assay adoption across regions systematically contributes to perceived ethnic prevalence gaps, especially for uncommon/compound EGFR variants.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Mutation-driven TKI benefit transcends ancestry</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Across Asian and Western cohorts, EGFR-mutant patients derive consistent PFS/ORR benefit from EGFR-TKIs relative to chemotherapy, whereas EGFR-wild-type patients do not; empiric TKI by ethnicity is not justified.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> First-line and subsequent lines in advanced NSCLC with confirmed EGFR status.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Uncommon variants show variable sensitivity; some rare/compound mutations respond better to second- or third-generation TKIs.</li>
                <li>CNS disease control differs by drug CNS penetration (e.g., osimertinib, aumolertinib).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Asian and European randomized trials show TKI superiority in EGFR-mutant cohorts (IPASS/OPTIMAL/EURTAC). <a href="../results/extraction-result-393.html#e393.0" class="evidence-link">[e393.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Reviews emphasize mutation-guided, not ethnicity-guided, therapy selection; EGFR-negative East Asian patients did worse on gefitinib monotherapy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.0" class="evidence-link">[e409.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.2" class="evidence-link">[e409.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Korean cohort shows 90% RR in EGFR-mutant vs 9% in wild-type on gefitinib, independent of ancestry contrasts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-370.html#e370.0" class="evidence-link">[e370.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Applies established principle to clarify clinical decision-making across ethnicities.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Strong consensus on mutation-driven benefit.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Tying the cross-ancestry therapeutic equivalence to caution against ethnicity-based empiric TKI use in regions with lower EGFR prevalence.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In multi-ethnic, population-based cohorts with universal NGS and similar histology/smoking distributions, the East Asian vs Western EGFR prevalence gap will narrow substantially.</li>
                <li>Expanding NGS coverage in Western centers will increase the fraction of detected uncommon/compound EGFR mutations, reducing apparent regional differences in mutation spectra.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systematic tissue adequacy improvement (liquid biopsy plus tissue NGS) will harmonize EGFR detection rates across regions to within ±5% once clinicopathologic composition is matched.</li>
                <li>Prospective registries that enforce testing prior to therapy initiation will show convergence of real-world response rates across ancestries after matching for mutation subtype and comutations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If, after matching for histology, smoking, sex, and using universal NGS, large residual East Asian vs Western EGFR prevalence differences persist, then composition/testing alone are insufficient.</li>
                <li>If adoption of NGS in Western centers does not increase uncommon/compound mutation detection rates, assay-based under-detection would be less explanatory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Potential germline predispositions (e.g., TERT or other loci) that could contribute to residual differences beyond composition/testing. <a href="../results/extraction-result-417.html#e417.0" class="evidence-link">[e417.0]</a> </li>
