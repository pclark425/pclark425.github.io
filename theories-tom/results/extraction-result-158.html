                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Correlation analysis of clinical, pathological, imaging and genetic features of ground-glass nodule featured lung adenocarcinomas between high-risk and non-high-risk individuals</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background Early stage lung adenocarcinomas manifested as ground-glass nodules (GGNs) are increasingly being detected, but screening and diagnosis for GGN-featured lung adenocarcinomas in different risk populations reach no agreement. Objectives To analyze the clinical, pathological, imaging and genetic features of GGN-featured lung adenocarcinomas on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in different risk groups. Methods Include patients with GGNs on HRCT surgically diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma in the West China Hospital, Sichuan University from 2009 to 2021, and their clinical, pathological, imaging and gene sequencing data. Results According to Chinese Expert Consensus on Screening and Management of Lung Cancer, 1,800 patients with GGN-featured lung adenocarcinoma, 545 males (incl. 269 smokers) and 1,255 females (incl. 16 smokers), were divided into high-risk (509) and non-high-risk (1,291) groups. Among them, 1,095 were detected via physical examination. The mean age at diagnosis was 54.78 (23–84) and the mean time from detection to diagnosis was 9.59 months. There were more males than females in the high-risk group [288 (56.58%) vs 221 (43.42%)], just the opposite in the non-high-risk group [1,034 (80.09%) vs 257 (19.91%)] (both P < 0.001). No statistical difference was found in GGN detection way (P > 0.05). The frequency of invasive adenocarcinoma was higher in the high-risk group, while those of precursor lesions and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma were higher in the non-high-risk group (all P < 0.001). The preoperative follow-up time in the non-high-risk group was shorter (P < 0.05). A total of 711 gene mutations were observed in 473 patients with a ratio of non-high-risk to high-risk of 494:217. The incidence of EGFR mutation was not statistically significant (P = 0.824), while those of TP53 and KRAS mutations were higher in the high-risk group (P < 0.05). Conclusions GGN-featured lung adenocarcinoma is dominated by non-high-risk female patients. Shorter preoperative follow-up in the non-high-risk group and no statistical difference in GGN detection way suggests the existing screening criteria for high-risk population may not suit GGN-featured lung cancer. In addition, the incidences of KRAS and TP53 mutations are higher in the high-risk group.
