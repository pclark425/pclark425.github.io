                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Genomic Profiling of Driver Gene Mutations in Chinese Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Worldwide, especially in China, lung cancer accounts to a major cause of mortality related to cancer. Treatment decisions mainly depend on oncogenic driver mutations, which offer novel therapeutic targets for anticancer therapy. However, studies of genomic profiling of driver gene mutations in mainland China are rare. Hence, this is an extensive study of these mutations in Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Chinese patients. Comparison of driver gene mutations of lung adenocarcinoma with other races showed that the mutational frequencies were similar within the different East Asian populations, while there were differences between East Asian and non-Asian populations. Further, four promising candidates for druggable mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were revealed that open up avenues to develop and design personal therapeutic approaches for patients harboring mutations. These results will help to develop personalized therapy targeting NSCLC.</p>

(2) Complementary observation: KRAS mutations are much less frequent in East Asian cohorts (8.5–11.7%) compared with non-Asian cohorts (≈33–34%), supporting a population-level shift in driver mutation spectra. These cross-study frequency differences are the primary empirical basis the paper cites for a role of race/ethnicity.</td>

The study also notes clinical-relevant observations: cfDNA samples showed higher frequency of resistance mutation T790M (5.1% in blood vs 2.1% in tissue), consistent with selection of resistant cases in the blood-sampled cohort; coexistence of EGFR with KRAS (found in 13 cases) or with BRAF (3 cases) and one triple mutation (EGFR L858R + EGFR T790M + KRAS G12D) were observed and may predict altered TKI responses (coexistence can indicate reduced EGFR-TKI efficacy).
