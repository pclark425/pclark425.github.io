                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Targeted therapies have shown promise in improving survival rates for lung adenocarcinoma, a common and deadly malignancy. EGFR -targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are particularly effective among these therapies in cases with EGFR mutations. Detecting these mutations before TKI treatment is essential. Various radiological features have been linked to EGFR mutations. However, the relationship between tumor location and mutation types in Indonesian lung adenocarcinoma patients remains unexplored. This study aimed to identify the frequency of EGFR mutation in local lung adenocarcinoma cases based on the tumor location. Clinical data of lung adenocarcinoma patients (n = 272) diagnosed between 2018 and 2022 were retrospectively taken from the Department of Anatomical Pathology, Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta. The qRT-PCR data of EGFR mutation status was obtained from the</p>
