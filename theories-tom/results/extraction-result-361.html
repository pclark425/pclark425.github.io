                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Spotlight on Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372) for EGFR Exon 20 Insertions Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Abstract Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients demonstrating sensitizing oncogenic driver mutations have derived clinical benefit from targeted therapy. EGFR mutations constitutively activate the signaling pathway, leading to prosurvival and antiapoptotic signals. Classic sensitizing EGFR mutations, such as exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R point mutations, respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). On the other hand, EGFR exon 20 in-frame insertions are observed in 4–12% of EGFR-mutated NSCLC and are resistant to targeted therapy with TKIs. In May 2021, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) provided accelerated approval to amivantamab (Rybrevant) in adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Here, we discuss properties of amivantamab, clinical trial results, and management of patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutated NSCLC.</p>
