                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Distinct EGFR Mutation Pattern in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Xuanwei Region of China: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background In the Xuanwei region of China, lung cancer incidence and mortality are among the highest in China, attributed to severe air pollution generated by combustion of smoky coal. No study has yet comprehensively evaluated the prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation characteristics in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Xuanwei. This meta-analysis was designed to analyze the EGFR mutation pattern in NSCLC patients in Xuanwei region of Yunnan Province in China. Methods Electronic databases were comprehensively searched and relevant literatures were retrieved. The odds ratio (OR) for EGFR mutations between Xuanwei region and non-Xuanwei region was calculated, and the absolute incidence of EGFR mutations in Xuanwei was pooled by mutation subtype. Results Seven studies involving 1,355 patients with NSCLC from Yunnan Province (442 in Xuanwei and 913 in other regions) were included. The EGFR mutation rate ranged between 30.19% and 55.56%. Higher uncommon EGFR mutations (OR: 5.69, 95%CI: 2.23–14.49, P<0.001) and lower common EGFR mutations (OR: 0.18, 95%CI: 0.07–0.45, P<0.001) were found in Xuanwei region, compared with non-Xuanwei region. Specifically, the uncommon EGFR mutation rate was 59.50% and common EGFR mutation rate was 40.50% in Xuanwei. The mutation incidence of exon 18 G719X (OR: 3.21, 95%CI: 1.48–6.97, P=0.003), exon 20 S768I (OR: 6.44; 95%CI: 2.66–15.60; P<0.001), and exon 18 G719X + 20 S768I (OR: 6.55; 95%CI: 1.92–22.33; P=0.003) in Xuanwei were significantly higher, while the frequency of 19 deletion (OR: 0.28, 95%CI: 0.11–0.77, P<0.001) and 21 L858R mutation (OR: 0.51, 95%CI: 0.31–0.84, P=0.007) were lower. Conclusions The results highlight the distinct EGFR mutation spectrum of NSCLC patients in Xuanwei region compared with other regions, with higher uncommon mutations but lower common mutations. The distinct Xuanwei featured genetic variations provide a unique model to further study carcinogenesis of lung cancer.</p>

(3) Prior studies (cited) linking EGFR exon 21 and exon 18 mutations with coal combustion emissions.

There is no direct genetic ancestry study proving a heritable predisposition; causal attribution to diet or genetics remains unproven and confounded by exposures. Similar overall EGFR mutation prevalence to other East Asian reports implies the difference is subtype-shift rather than overall EGFR predisposition.</td>

The authors note that Xuanwei patients with EGFR mutations have poorer prognosis after EGFR-TKI, possibly due to high uncommon-mutation frequency, indicating need for mutation-subtype–aware therapeutic choices and further study.</td>
