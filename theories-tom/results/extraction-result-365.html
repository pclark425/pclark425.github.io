                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> The Association between Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Gene Polymorphisms and Lung Cancer Risk</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in cell proliferation and signaling. In this study, we examined the association between EGFR gene polymorphisms and lung cancer risk among the Jordanian population. A total of 129 patients with primary lung cancer and 129 matched healthy controls were recruited into this study. EGFR rs712829, rs712830, rs2072454, and rs11543848 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped to test for their association with lung cancer risk. A significant association was observed between the rs712829 SNP and lung cancer risk (p < 0.05) where the GG + GT genotypes were higher in lung cancer patients when compared to controls. In addition, no association was detected between rs712830, rs2072454, and rs11543848 SNPs and lung cancer risk. When patients were stratified according to the lung cancer type, a significant association was detected between both rs712829 and rs2072454 and adenocarcinoma lung cancer (p < 0.05). Haplotype analysis of all four SNPs showed a significant association between the TCCG haplotype and both lung cancer and the adenocarcinoma subtype (p < 0.001). In conclusion, EGFR rs712829, rs2072454 SNPs, and TCCG haplotypes are associated with a risk of lung cancer among Jordanians. Since genetic associations are affected by the genetic background of populations, more studies in other Arab populations are required to confirm the present findings.</p>
