                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> East meets West: ethnic differences in epidemiology and clinical behaviors of lung cancer between East Asians and Caucasians</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with large variation of the incidence and mortality across regions. Although the mortality of lung cancer has been decreasing, or steady in the US, it has been increasing in Asia for the past two decades. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and other risk factors such as indoor coal burning, cooking fumes, and infections may play important roles in the development of lung cancer among Asian never smoking women. The median age of diagnosis in Asian patients with lung cancer is generally younger than Caucasian patients, particularly among never-smokers. Asians and Caucasians may have different genetic susceptibilities to lung cancer, as evidenced from candidate polymorphisms and genome-wide association studies. Recent epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have shown consistently that Asian ethnicity is a favorable prognostic factor for overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), independent of smoking status. Compared with Caucasian patients with NSCLC, East Asian patients have a much higher prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (approximately 30% vs. 7%, predominantly among patients with adenocarcinoma and never-smokers), a lower prevalence of K-Ras mutation (less than 10% vs. 18%, predominantly among patients with adenocarcinoma and smokers), and higher proportion of patients who are responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The ethnic differences in epidemiology and clinical behaviors should be taken into account when conducting global clinical trials that include different ethnic populations.</p>

The paper emphasizes that the exact mechanism remains unclear.</td>

                            <td>Genetic: the review cites studies suggesting CASSR1 polymorphic types and promoter polymorphisms that could reduce intrinsic EGFR production as plausible contributors (references cited in the review); GWAS evidence: a locus at 5p15.33 (TERT-CLPTM1L, rs2736100) is associated with risk for lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking Asian women with larger effect sizes than in European smokers, suggesting population-specific genetic susceptibility. Epidemiologic/environmental: higher proportions of never-smokers among Asian lung cancer patients and documented regional exposures (indoor coal burning, cooking fumes, infections) are presented as plausible contributors to different etiologies and therefore different somatic mutation profiles. Clinical correlation: multiple clinical trials (IPASS, OPTIMAL) and registry analyses show strong correlation between EGFR mutation status and TKI response, and these trials included East Asian enriched cohorts.</td>

                            <td>The paper notes absence of conclusive proof: it states the reason for high EGFR mutation frequency in Asians is unclear and that the genetic hypotheses are suggested rather than proven; GWAS loci identified in predominantly Caucasian studies (6p21.33, 15q25) were not convincingly associated in the Asian studies for lung cancer overall or adenocarcinoma, indicating differences in genetic architecture but not a definitive causal mechanism. The authors explicitly state uncertainty whether differences are driven by smoking status, ethnicity per se, or other variables, and no definitive causal linkage between environmental exposures and EGFR mutation frequency is established in the review.</td>

                            <td>Higher EGFR mutation prevalence in East Asians explains, in part, higher response rates to EGFR TKIs and greater PFS benefit seen in trials enrolling East Asian or clinically selected (adenocarcinoma, never/light-smoker) patients (IPASS: gefitinib superior for response rate 43.0% vs. 32.2% and PFS HR=0.74 in intent-to-treat; in EGFR-mutant subgroup PFS HR=0.48 favoring gefitinib). OPTIMAL (Chinese patients) showed PFS 13.1 vs. 4.6 months (erlotinib vs chemo, HR=0.16). Registry and pooled-trial data: EGFR-mutant patients have substantially higher response rates and longer PFS/OS on EGFR TKIs (e.g., median PFS ~11.8 months and OS ~23.9 months in a pooled Western registry of EGFR-mutant patients). The paper also notes that exon 19 deletions have better outcomes than L858R, which may influence prognosis and treatment expectations. Authors recommend considering ethnic differences in global trial design and stratification and prioritizing trials in Asian populations because of these differences.</td>
