                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background Limited data are available on the prevalence of oncogenic driver mutations in Caucasian populations, and especially in Europeans. Aim To evaluate the targetable mutational spectra in unselected patients with lung adenocarcinoma in routine clinical practice from several French hospitals, using the same molecular platform. Patients and Methods Samples from 2,219 consecutive patients with histologically-proven advanced lung adenocarcinoma were centrally analysed at a referenced and certified diagnostic platform in order to test for activating and resistance mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2 and PI3KCA. Demographic and clinical features were retrieved from the medical charts. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to determine the independent predictive factors for the occurrence of specific mutations, in the whole study population or in selected subgroups. Findings The overall respective incidence of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2 and PI3KCA mutations was 10.5%, 0.9%, 25%, 1.5%, 2.1% and 1.4%, in our study sample including 87.4% white Caucasians, 10.8% Africans and 1.8% Asians; 60.6% men, 30.7% never smoker (median age: 68.3 years). Ethnicity was an independent predictor for EGFR, KRAS and ERBB2 gene abnormalities. In all cases, a significantly higher prevalence of targetable EGFR and ERBB2, and a lower prevalence of resistance KRAS mutations were observed in African women as compared to African men or Caucasians. Conclusions In real life conditions of routine genetic testing, we have identified subsets of patients with specific targetable activating somatic mutations according to ethnicity, who could preferentially benefit from anti-EGFR and anti-ERBB2 targeted therapies.</p>
