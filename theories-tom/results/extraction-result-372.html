                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Predisposition to Lung Adenocarcinoma in a Family Harboring the Germline EGFR V843I Mutation</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), most commonly a deletion in exon 19 or an L858R substitution in exon 21, are frequent in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer. These EGFR mutations are speculated to constitutively activate EGFR through phosphorylation and impart tumorigenic properties. Most EGFR mutations occur in somatic tumor tissue, with germline EGFR mutations being extremely rare. As a scarce example, the germline EGFR T790M or germline V843I mutation has been identified in several families susceptible to lung cancer.</p>
