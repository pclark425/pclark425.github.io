                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Navigating the “No Man's Land” of TKI-Failed EGFR-Mutated Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): A Review</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> As the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, lung cancer is a worldwide health issue that is overwhelmingly caused by smoking. However, a substantial minority (~25%) of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has never smoked. In these patients, activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are more likely, which render their tumors susceptible for a finite period to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and confer a better prognosis than EGFR wild-type NSCLC. On progression, due to the inevitable insurgence of resistance, TKIs are generally followed by second- or third-line salvage chemotherapy until treatment failure, after which no standard treatment options are available, resulting in a poor prognosis and a high risk of death. With the focus of clinical attention on treatment with TKIs, few studies on optimal salvage therapies, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, after failure of EGFR TKIs have been reported. Despite a paucity of available data, the aim of this review is to summarize the “no-man's land” of TKI-failed EGFR-mutated NSCLC and expand on alternative strategies as well as potential future directions.</p>

Additionally, tumors from smokers have higher overall mutational burden (from tobacco carcinogens) which reduces the relative proportion of EGFR-driven cancers and affects immunotherapy responsiveness due to neoantigen load.</td>

                            <td>The paper proposes several (not mutually exclusive) explanations: (1) epidemiologic/demographic differences — higher proportion of never-smokers (especially women) in East Asian cohorts leads to higher EGFR mutation frequency; (2) exposure to non-tobacco carcinogens (unspecified) may drive EGFR mutagenesis in never-smokers; (3) lower overall mutational burden in never-smoker EGFR+ tumors (versus smoker tumors) reflects different carcinogenic exposures and biologic pathways, making EGFR-driven tumors relatively more common in those populations. The paper does not provide specific genetic polymorphisms or validated environmental agents as causal evidence.</td>

                            <td>The review notes potential confounding by smoking behavior (pack-years inversely correlate with EGFR mutation rate), sex composition of cohorts, and survival differences (e.g., longer survival on TKIs may influence observed metastatic patterns). It also does not present direct evidence for specific environmental or germline genetic causes, so the ethnic difference could be due to demographic and exposure differences rather than innate genetic susceptibility; variability across studies and citation-based reporting are additional limitations.</td>
