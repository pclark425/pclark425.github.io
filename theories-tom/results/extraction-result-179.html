                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> The prevalence of EGFR mutation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Objectives Estimate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation prevalence in all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and patient subgroups. Results A total of 456 studies were included, reporting 30,466 patients with EGFR mutation among 115,815 NSCLC patients. The overall pooled prevalence for EGFR mutations was 32.3% (95% CI 30.9% to 33.7%), ranging from 38.4% (95% CI: 36.5% to 40.3%) in China to 14.1% (95% CI: 12.7% to 15.5%) in Europe. The pooled prevalence of EGFR mutation was higher in females (females vs. males: 43.7% vs. 24.0%; OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.5 to 2.9), non-smokers (non-smokers vs. past or current smokers: 49.3% vs. 21.5%; OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 3.4 to 4.0), and patients with adenocarcinoma (adenocarcinoma vs. non-adenocarcinoma: 38.0% vs. 11.7%; OR: 4.1, 95% CI: 3.6 to 4.8). Materials and Methods PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to June 2013. Eligible studies reported EGFR mutation prevalence and the association with at least one of the following factors: gender, smoking status and histology. Random-effects models were used to pool EGFR mutation prevalence data. Conclusion This study provides the exact prevalence of EGFR mutations in different countries and NSCLC patient subgroups.</p>

(2012) linking mitochondrial complex I mutations with EGFR mutations; Kawahara et al.

Some studies find EGFR mutation status independently associated with outcomes regardless of sex/smoking (suggesting complex biology), and direct population genetics demonstrating ancestry causal alleles are limited in the cited literature.</td>
