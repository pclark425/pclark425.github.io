                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Biomarkers/Molecular Targets, Immunotherapy, and Treatments for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> For decades, the prognosis for patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was bleak, with chemotherapy offering limited benefit and much toxicity. Now, with mutational testing, new generations of targeted therapies, and emerging immunotherapies, the treatment horizon for these patients has greatly expanded. In this article, the authors review molecular targets, biomarkers, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are having a major impact on the management of this patient population.</p>
