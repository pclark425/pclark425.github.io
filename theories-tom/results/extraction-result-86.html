                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma differ by frequency and type between Uighur and Han ethnic groups in Xinjiang Autonomous Region</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background This study was designed to investigate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation types affecting lung cancer treatment in patients in Xinjiang, China. We detected and analyzed differences in the EGFR mutation points of Uighur and Han patients with lung adenocarcinoma. We examined 181 specimens of lung adenocarcinoma tissue embedded with paraffin (76 Uighur and 105 Han patients) for mutations in the EGFR gene in exon 18-21 by the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) method. We used the chi-square statistical method to analyze the relationship between mutations and patients’ clinical parameters. Results EGFR somatic mutations were detected in 59 of 181 cases (32.6%). The mutation rate was higher in Han patients (45.7%) than in Uighur patients (15.8%) (P < 0.001). The main mutation types were the exon 19 deletion and the L858R point mutation in exon 21. In Han patients we found 21 (44.7%) cases of exon 19 deletion, 24 (51.1%) cases of L858R in exon 21, 1 case (2.1%) with mutations in both exon 19 and exon 21, and 1 case (2.1%) with T790 mutation in exon 20. In Uighur patients we found 8 (66.7%) cases of exon 19 deletion and 4 (33.3%) cases of L858R in exon 21. Conclusions In comparing these groups, the exon 19 deletion was more common than L858R in exon 21 in Uighur patients. In Han patients, EGFR-sensitive mutations occurred in female, never-smoking patients with well-differentiated tumors; but for Uighur patients only smoking history showed an obvious correlation.</p>
