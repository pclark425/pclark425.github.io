                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> EGFR mutation prevalence in Asia-Pacific and Russian patients with advanced NSCLC of adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma histology_ The IGNITE study</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Objectives: Limited understanding exists of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation frequency in less common subgroups of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma [SCC]), and to what extent local practices exclude patients from EGFR testing based on their clinical characteristics. Materials and methods: IGNITE (non-comparative/-interventional; NCT01788163) was conducted in 90 centres (Asia-Pacific/Russia). Eligible patients: local/metastatic aNSCLC; chemotherapy-naïve, newly-diagnosed/recurrent disease after resection; ineligible for curative treatment. Patients provided a tissue/cytology (all) and a blood plasma (China/Russia/South Korea/Taiwan) sample. Primary endpoint: EGFR mutation frequency in aNSCLC patients (adenocarcinoma [ADC]/non-ADC), as per local practices. Results: 3382 patients were enrolled. EGFR mutation frequencies for evaluable tissue/cytology samples in AsiaPacific and Russian patients: 49.3% (862/1749) and 18.0% (90/500) for ADC tumours; 14.1% (74/525) and 3.7% (15/402) for non-ADC; 9.9% (40/403) and 3.7% (13/349) for SCC. Of Russian patients with SCC tumours harbouring common, activating EGFR mutations, 6/9 were never-/former-smokers. Mutation status concordance between 2581 matched tissue/cytology and plasma samples: 80.5% (sensitivity 46.9%, specificity 95.6%). Conclusion: EGFR mutation testing should be considered in all Asian aNSCLC patients.

                            <td>No specific molecular mechanism proposed; the authors emphasize that observed ethnic differences likely reflect a combination of (a) differing prevalence of clinical characteristics associated with EGFR mutations (ADC histology, female, never-smoker), (b) true ethnic/regional differences in mutation prevalence, and (c) methodological/testing and sampling differences which can influence measured prevalence and subtype detection (e.g., unusual variants not covered by some assays).</td>

Multivariate model reported an odds ratio for region (Asia-Pacific vs Russia) of 3.929 (95% CI lower bound reported as 2.997; upper bound truncated in table), indicating substantially higher odds of EGFR-positivity in Asia-Pacific vs Russia. Other reported ORs (e.g., ADC vs non-ADC OR 3.973 (95% CI 2.943, 5.364)) also quantify related associations.</td>

                            <td>Noted confounders include substantial differences in local testing methods and assay coverage (some Russian tumour tests did not cover key exons), lack of ctDNA-optimized DNA extraction kits in Russian labs (reducing plasma sensitivity), variable plasma assay cut-offs leading to false positives, differences in sample origin (primary tumour vs metastasis), biopsy method, and local policies that may limit testing of certain clinical subgroups. These factors likely affected observed mutation frequencies and plasma:tissue concordance.</td>

                            <td>Russian (largely Caucasian) patients in IGNITE had markedly lower EGFR mutation prevalence than Asia-Pacific patients across histologies (ADC 18.0% vs 49.3%); Russian mutation-positive samples showed a higher relative proportion of rare/unusual EGFR variants (19.1% vs 8.6% in Asia-Pacific). Plasma testing sensitivity and specificity were notably lower in Russia, attributed to suboptimal ctDNA extraction methods, assay exon coverage gaps, and variable assay cut-offs. Authors recommend careful attention to testing methodology and consideration of EGFR testing in selected non-ADC Caucasian patients (e.g., never-/former-smokers).</td>
