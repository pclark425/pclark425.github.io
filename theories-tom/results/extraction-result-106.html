                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background: Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the world. The percentage of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is about 80% of the incidence of lung cancer. A type of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, is usually found in the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Case: A male patient aged 70 years old, an active smoker, works as a farmer. He experienced shortness of breath and chest pain for three months. There was no family history of suffering from malignancy. The cytology result of the right pleural fluid indicated adenocarcinoma. He was diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (D) stage IV positive mutation of EGFR exon 18 (G719S), 20 (T790M), and 21 (L858R) with Karnofsky score of 70. He could survive for more than 11 months with the treatment of EGFR TKI, and received a good therapeutic response. Initially, for the first six months, it was such a progressive disease, and for the next eleven months it became stable. Discussion: Lung adenocarcinoma has a higher EGFR mutation rate than that of other types of NSCLC. EGFR mutations usually occur in the first four exons that have a code for Tyrosine Kinase (TK), such as deletion (usually five amino acids) in exon 19 and leucine-to-arginine missens mutations in codon 858 of exon 21 (L858R). Conclusion: In addition to exon mutations found in this case, cells in the tumor will continue to grow and develop into new mutants that are immune to drugs and rapidly split themselves into new, different forms. The therapy for complex mutations is still being developed. EGFR TKI therapy in this patient had a relatively good response. Further understanding of molecular biology of lung cancer is seriously required.</p>
