                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Analysis of tumor abnormal protein expression and epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status in non-small cell lung cancer</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background The level of tumor abnormal protein (TAP) level has a significant impact on tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis. Previous studies have highlighted the influence of the mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), particularly the sensitivity displayed by tumor cells to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy. Our study is centered on exploring the clinical relevance of TAP and EGFR mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Material and methods In this study, tissue samples were collected from a total of 176 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Real-time PCR technology was utilized to detect mutations within exons 19 and 21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in these samples. This approach enables precise identification of EGFR mutations associated with NSCLC. Furthermore, the study investigated the impact of various tumor markers, including tumor abnormal protein (TAP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), on EGFR mutation status. Established assays were employed to evaluate TAP and CEA levels, aiming to ascertain their potential correlation with EGFR mutation in NSCLC patients. Results EGFR exhibited mutation rates of 23.86% and 12.50% in exons 19 and 21, respectively. EGFR mutations were more prevalent in younger women (< 60 years old) and in cases with pleural invasion, vessel invasion, CEA > 6.5 ng/mL, and TAP > 228 µm2 for both genders. Increased TAP levels independently predicted EGFR mutations (P = 0.001 for males; P = 0.000 for females). An area under the curve (AUC) of 0.833 indecated EGFR mutation prediction with sensitivity and specificity of 79.7% and 87.0%, respectively. For females, the sensitivity increased to 89.7% and specificity increased to 93.8%. Conclusions TAP effectively predicts EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients with moderate accuracy, particularly benefiting diagnosis in females with high sensitivity and specificity. Integrating TAP assessment into EGFR mutation testing can significantly enhance diagnostic precision, especially in female NSCLC cases.
