                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional–genetic–testing synergy model for East Asian EGFR prevalence</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why activating EGFR mutations in lung cancer are more common in East Asian populations, and how this relates to responsiveness to EGFR kinase inhibitors, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The observed excess of EGFR-activating mutations in East Asian lung cancer reflects a synergy of (i) compositional differences—higher proportions of never-smokers, women, and adenocarcinoma histology—which strongly predict EGFR positivity; (ii) germline background that increases non-tobacco adenocarcinoma risk in East Asian never-smoking females (e.g., stronger TERT 5p15.33 effect), enriching the pool from which EGFR-driven tumors arise even though pathogenic germline EGFR variants are rare; and (iii) testing/ascertainment biases—historic reliance on targeted assays (ARMS-PCR) that detect classical hotspots but miss rare/compound alleles, optional testing and unevaluable biopsies in trials—that distort both overall prevalence and subtype spectra. Together, these factors yield higher reported EGFR prevalence and a classical-mutation dominance in East Asian series, while TKI responsiveness remains mutation- not ethnicity-determined.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Composition: adenocarcinoma, never-smoking, and female sex strongly enrich EGFR mutations; East Asian series contain more of these strata</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> EGFR mutation prevalence is substantially higher in adenocarcinoma than non-adenocarcinoma and in never-smokers and women; East Asian cohorts with higher proportions of these groups exhibit higher overall EGFR prevalence.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Clinical NSCLC series profiled for EGFR exons 18–21 across East Asian centers; applicable to observational and surgical cohorts.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In men, associations with smoking can be weaker or absent in some cohorts, implying additional biological contributors.</li>
                <li>Squamous histology has low EGFR prevalence except for rare subgroups.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

            <h3>Statement 1: Germline architecture enriches non-tobacco adenocarcinoma risk in East Asian never-smoking females</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> East Asian never-smoking females carry a stronger risk effect at 5p15.33 (TERT intron 2 rs2736100), increasing non-tobacco adenocarcinoma incidence and thereby enlarging the pool from which EGFR-driven tumors arise, even though pathogenic germline EGFR variants are rare.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Population-level germline risk for lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking East Asian women; does not assert direct germline causation of somatic EGFR mutations.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pathogenic germline EGFR variants (e.g., T790M) are rare and not a major contributor to East Asian population-level prevalence.</li>
                <li>Smoking-related germline risk loci (e.g., 15q25) show weaker or null effects in this never-smoker context.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>GWAS in never-smoking East Asian females: strong association at 5p15.33 (TERT rs2736100) with adenocarcinoma risk (OR ~1.54), larger than in European smoker cohorts; indoor inhalants discussed as relevant exposures. <a href="../results/extraction-result-417.html#e417.0" class="evidence-link">[e417.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Germline EGFR pathogenic variants are rare across cohorts (e.g., no germline T790M in 627 Japanese; low prevalence in large screens). <a href="../results/extraction-result-405.html#e405.0" class="evidence-link">[e405.0]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Combines known germline risk with somatic driver distribution to explain prevalence differences.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> TERT locus association in East Asian never-smoking females is established; germline EGFR pathogenic variants are rare.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Linking TERT-driven enrichment of non-tobacco adenocarcinoma to a larger reservoir for EGFR-driven tumors as a compositional mechanism for regional EGFR excess.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Testing/ascertainment biases magnify observed prevalence and shape subtype spectra</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Historic reliance on targeted assays (e.g., ARMS-PCR) that focus on classical hotspots and optional testing with frequent unevaluable biopsies have biased observed EGFR prevalence and undercounted rare/compound alleles; broader NGS adoption increases detection breadth, altering reported subtype distributions.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Retrospective and trial cohorts (2005–2020s) in which EGFR testing was optional or performed with limited-scope assays; applies to both Asian and non-Asian settings but interacts with regional practice patterns.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>ARMS-PCR has high sensitivity for predefined hotspots but misses novel/rare and compound alleles; NGS breadth improves detection at the cost of analysis complexity.</li>
                <li>Limiting assays to exons 19 and 21 (as in some cohorts) underestimates total EGFR-positive burden and misclassifies uncommon variants.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Direct case evidence: ARMS-PCR was negative but 425-gene NGS detected rare compound EGFR L833V/H835L. <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.3" class="evidence-link">[e411.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Compound EGFR mutations occur in ~4–14% of EGFR-mutant tumors; rare/compound variants often missed by limited panels. <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.2" class="evidence-link">[e411.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Classical mutations (exon 19 del and L858R) account for ~85–90% of detected EGFR mutations in literature that often used hotspot assays. <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.1" class="evidence-link">[e411.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Optional EGFR testing and many unevaluable samples in trials (e.g., only 31/133 and 74/236 East Asian never-smokers evaluable), introducing selection/measurement bias. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.1" class="evidence-link">[e409.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.2" class="evidence-link">[e409.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.0" class="evidence-link">[e409.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Single-center cohorts used ARMS or limited Sanger panels (e.g., testing only exons 19/21 in Pakistan), constraining detection and affecting observed prevalence/subtype spectra. <a href="../results/extraction-result-381.html#e381.0" class="evidence-link">[e381.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-380.html#e380.0" class="evidence-link">[e380.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-382.html#e382.0" class="evidence-link">[e382.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Methodological critique synthesized into a prevalence-explanatory component.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Methodologic limitations of ARMS versus NGS and optional testing/unevaluable samples in trials are known.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Arguing these biases systematically magnify perceived East–West prevalence gaps and shape classical-versus-uncommon subtype distributions reported in earlier series.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adjusting for histology, sex, and smoking in multi-region cohorts will substantially attenuate (but not eliminate) the East Asian vs Western difference in EGFR prevalence.</li>
                <li>Prospective universal NGS testing (vs hotspot assays) in East Asian centers will increase observed rates of uncommon/compound EGFR variants and modestly reduce the relative proportion of classical mutations.</li>
                <li>Cohorts that limit testing to exons 19 and 21 will underreport EGFR positivity compared to comprehensive exon 18–21 profiling, with larger underestimation in populations enriched for uncommon/compound alleles.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Polygenic risk scores that include 5p15.33 and related loci will predict a higher baseline probability of EGFR-driven tumors within never-smoker East Asian women compared with matched Western never-smokers.</li>
                <li>Family-based East Asian cohorts will show modest enrichment of non-pathogenic germline EGFR-region haplotypes in EGFR-mutant probands compared with EGFR-wildtype adenocarcinoma probands, reflecting cis-regulatory predisposition.</li>
                <li>Standardizing testing (universal NGS) across East Asian and Western centers will further narrow reported EGFR prevalence differences, particularly for uncommon subtypes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If after strict adjustment for histology, sex, and smoking, large multi-region cohorts still show an unchanged East–West EGFR prevalence gap, compositional explanations alone are insufficient.</li>
                <li>If universal NGS does not increase uncommon/compound detection relative to ARMS in the same population, the testing-bias component would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If TERT 5p15.33 risk does not stratify adenocarcinoma incidence in never-smoking East Asian women in replication studies, the germline-composition link would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Environmental promotion via PM2.5/indoor particulates (mechanistic role of IL-1β) is not explicitly modeled here but may interact with composition to shape prevalence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-408.html#e408.1" class="evidence-link">[e408.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-408.html#e408.0" class="evidence-link">[e408.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Rare EGFR mutations in squamous histology (e.g., Korean male smokers with SCC) indicate niche subgroups outside the composition model. <a href="../results/extraction-result-377.html#e377.0" class="evidence-link">[e377.0]</a> </li>
    <li>EGFR mutations are rare in ESCC in Central Asia, illustrating organ-specific etiologies and mechanisms of EGFR dysregulation (overexpression vs mutation) not captured by this model. <a href="../results/extraction-result-373.html#e373.0" class="evidence-link">[e373.0]</a> </li>
