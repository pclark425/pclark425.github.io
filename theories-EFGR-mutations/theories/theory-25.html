                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Pollution-promoted EGFR selection model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why activating EGFR mutations in lung cancer are more common in East Asian populations, and how this relates to responsiveness to EGFR kinase inhibitors, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Pre-existing oncogenic EGFR mutations are detectable in normal lung epithelia. In regions with higher ambient and indoor particulate exposure (notably parts of East Asia), chronic PM2.5-driven inflammation (via macrophage recruitment and IL-1β) promotes clonal expansion and malignant progression of EGFR-mutant alveolar type II cells, especially among never-smokers. This increases the proportion of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma observed in East Asian clinical series. Once EGFR driver mutations are present, therapeutic responsiveness to EGFR TKIs is driven by mutation status rather than ethnicity.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: PM2.5-IL-1β promotion preferentially expands pre-existing EGFR-mutant clones</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Higher PM2.5 exposure causally promotes expansion and malignant outgrowth of pre-existing EGFR-mutant alveolar cells via macrophage recruitment and IL-1β signaling, raising the incidence fraction of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma in exposed populations.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Population and cellular scales: never-smokers and light-smokers in regions with elevated PM2.5; applies to lung adenocarcinoma initiation/promotion; not intended to explain tobacco mutagenesis spectra.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>At very low PM2.5 exposure, promotion is weak and enrichment of EGFR-mutant tumors diminishes.</li>
                <li>Heavy tobacco exposure can dominate initiation with distinct mutation spectra (e.g., KRAS, TP53), attenuating relative EGFR contribution.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Ambient PM2.5 correlates with increased incidence/progression of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma across cohorts; mouse models show macrophage/IL-1β-driven promotion, and ultra-deep sequencing detects oncogenic EGFR mutations in normal lung. <a href="../results/extraction-result-408.html#e408.1" class="evidence-link">[e408.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-408.html#e408.0" class="evidence-link">[e408.0]</a> </li>
    <li>East Asian cohorts (Korea, Taiwan, China) are represented in the PM2.5-EGFR analyses; East Asia bears high PM burden in multiple settings. <a href="../results/extraction-result-408.html#e408.1" class="evidence-link">[e408.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-408.html#e408.0" class="evidence-link">[e408.0]</a> </li>
    <li>EGFR-mutant disease is highly prevalent among East Asian never-smokers with adenocarcinoma, consistent with a promoter-dominant, non-tobacco pathway. <a href="../results/extraction-result-419.html#e419.0" class="evidence-link">[e419.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.2" class="evidence-link">[e409.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.1" class="evidence-link">[e409.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-393.html#e393.0" class="evidence-link">[e393.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-382.html#e382.0" class="evidence-link">[e382.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-389.html#e389.0" class="evidence-link">[e389.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-380.html#e380.0" class="evidence-link">[e380.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Integrates mechanistic promotion biology with regional exposure gradients to explain an ethnicity-associated prevalence pattern.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Causal PM2.5→IL-1β promotion for EGFR-mutant alveolar cells and epidemiologic association with EGFR-mutant lung cancer are reported (Hill et al. 2023; subsequent reviews).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Framing regional PM2.5 exposure as a principal driver of the East Asian enrichment of EGFR-mutant adenocarcinoma via preferential promotion of pre-existing EGFR-mutant clones.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Mutation status, not ancestry, governs TKI benefit</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Given an activating EGFR mutation, the magnitude and direction of benefit from EGFR-TKIs are similar across ancestries; the East Asian advantage in TKI-responsive cases arises primarily from higher mutation prevalence rather than differential pharmacodynamic efficacy.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> First-line and later-line systemic therapy for advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC across global populations.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Uncommon and compound EGFR variants display heterogeneous TKI sensitivity and may deviate from classical responders.</li>
                <li>Acquired resistance mechanisms (T790M after first/second-generation TKIs; C797X, MET/HER2 amplification after osimertinib) modulate durability across all ancestries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Narrative reviews emphasize mutation status—not ethnicity—predicts response; pooled figures show ~68% response in EGFR-positive versus ~11% in EGFR-negative patients. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.0" class="evidence-link">[e409.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-393.html#e393.0" class="evidence-link">[e393.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Asian and Western randomized trials both show marked PFS benefit of TKIs in EGFR-mutant tumors (e.g., IPASS/OPTIMAL in Asia; EURTAC in Europe). <a href="../results/extraction-result-393.html#e393.0" class="evidence-link">[e393.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Within East Asian cohorts, EGFR-mutant cases have high response rates to TKIs independent of ethnicity comparison (e.g., Korean cohort RR 90% mutant vs 9% wild-type). <a href="../results/extraction-result-370.html#e370.0" class="evidence-link">[e370.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Reweights established observations toward a composition-based explanation for ethnic outcome differences.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Broad consensus that EGFR activating mutations predict TKI response across populations.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Attributing East Asian clinical outcome advantages largely to higher prevalence (composition) rather than ethnicity-intrinsic pharmacology.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In East Asian cities with recent PM2.5 reductions, the proportion of EGFR-mutant adenocarcinomas among never-smokers diagnosed 5–10 years later will decline relative to historical baselines.</li>
                <li>Never-smoker cohorts across regions matched for PM2.5 exposure will show similar EGFR-mutant fractions irrespective of ancestry.</li>
                <li>In normal lung tissues from highly exposed never-smokers, the size (VAF) and frequency of EGFR-mutant clones will correlate with local PM2.5 exposure metrics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pharmacologic IL-1β blockade (e.g., canakinumab) in high-PM geographies will reduce incidence of EGFR-mutant adenocarcinoma disproportionately versus KRAS-mutant tumors.</li>
                <li>Seasonal wildfire smoke surges will temporarily increase detection of expanding EGFR-mutant fields (tracked by serial liquid biopsy) in never-smokers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding no correlation between PM2.5 exposure and EGFR-mutant tumor fraction across cities after adjusting for smoking would argue against promotion-driven enrichment.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating equal EGFR-mutant clone burdens in normal lungs from low- and high-PM regions would contradict the promotion mechanism.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Rare inherited EGFR pathogenic variants (e.g., germline T790M, V843I, P848L) that can drive EGFR-mutant tumors independent of environmental promotion. <a href="../results/extraction-result-405.html#e405.0" class="evidence-link">[e405.0]</a> </li>
