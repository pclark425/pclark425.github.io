                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why EGFR activating mutations in lung cancer are more common in patients of East Asian descent compared to other populations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> East Asian genetic ancestry confers increased susceptibility to acquiring somatic EGFR activating mutations in lung epithelial cells through inherited genomic features that influence DNA repair, chromatin accessibility, or mutational processes at the EGFR locus. This ancestry-linked susceptibility operates independently of environmental exposures and manifests as a 2-4 fold increased probability of EGFR mutation occurrence in lung adenocarcinomas, with a continuous dose-response relationship to ancestry proportion.</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: East Asian Ancestry Dose-Response Relationship</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The proportion of East Asian genetic ancestry in an individual's genome is positively and continuously associated with the probability of harboring somatic EGFR activating mutations in lung adenocarcinoma, with each increment in East Asian ancestry proportion increasing EGFR mutation odds by approximately 2-fold per ancestry tercile, independent of smoking status, sex, and age.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to lung adenocarcinoma patients across admixed and non-admixed populations where genetic ancestry can be quantified using genome-wide markers (e.g., ancestry-informative markers, AIM-INDELs, or genome-wide SNP arrays). The relationship holds in populations with varying baseline EGFR mutation frequencies (10-60%), across all smoking statuses (never-smokers to heavy smokers), both sexes, and adult age ranges (typically 25-85 years in studied cohorts). Predominantly applies to adenocarcinoma histology where EGFR mutations are most common; less applicable to squamous cell carcinoma where EGFR mutations are rare (2-10% even in Asian populations).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect magnitude may be modified by specific environmental exposures not yet identified (e.g., biomass fuel exposure, specific air pollutants)</li>
                <li>Relationship assumes ancestry is measured accurately using validated genome-wide markers rather than self-reported ethnicity, which can be imprecise especially in admixed populations</li>
                <li>May not apply to non-adenocarcinoma histologies where EGFR mutations are rare (<5% in squamous cell carcinoma across all ancestries)</li>
                <li>Very recent admixture (1-2 generations) may show different patterns than stable admixed populations</li>
                <li>Effect size estimates vary somewhat across studies (OR 1.5-3.0) likely due to methodological differences in ancestry quantification and EGFR testing</li>
            </ol>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the East Asian enrichment is among the most well-established observations in lung cancer genomics, the specific quantitative ancestry dose-response framework with genetic measurement (AIM-INDELs) and explicit hypothesis of inherited susceptibility loci separable from environmental confounders represents a mechanistic refinement that advances from descriptive epidemiology to testable genetic hypotheses.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The association between East Asian ethnicity/ancestry and higher EGFR mutation prevalence has been extensively documented in descriptive epidemiological studies since gefitinib/erlotinib trials in the mid-2000s, with hundreds of studies confirming the pattern across diverse East Asian populations (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formulation as a continuous dose-response relationship with quantified genetic ancestry proportion (rather than categorical self-reported ethnicity) demonstrated through admixture analysis in Brazilian population, and the mechanistic framing as inherited genomic susceptibility loci rather than environmental or social factors represents a novel quantitative refinement of the qualitative observation.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Smoking-Independent Ancestry Effect</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The association between East Asian ancestry and increased EGFR mutation frequency operates independently of tobacco smoking exposure, with ancestry effects persisting after statistical adjustment for smoking status (never/former/current), pack-years, and within smoking-stratified subgroup analyses. The ancestry effect is observable in both never-smokers and smokers, though absolute EGFR mutation rates are 2-5 fold higher in never-smokers across all ancestries.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to lung adenocarcinoma patients across the full spectrum of smoking exposures from lifetime never-smokers (<100 cigarettes lifetime) to heavy smokers (>40 pack-years). The independence of ancestry and smoking effects is demonstrable through: (1) multivariate regression models adjusting for both factors simultaneously, (2) smoking-stratified analyses showing ancestry differences within each smoking stratum, and (3) never-smoker-only cohorts showing persistent ancestry differences. Applicable across adult age ranges and both sexes, predominantly in adenocarcinoma histology.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Absolute EGFR mutation rates are consistently 2-5 fold higher in never-smokers compared to smokers across all ancestries, indicating strong smoking effect operates in parallel with ancestry effect</li>
                <li>The magnitude of absolute ancestry difference may vary between smoking strata (e.g., ancestry effect may be larger in never-smokers than smokers in absolute percentage points)</li>
                <li>Does not exclude possible gene-environment interactions where specific smoking-related carcinogens might differentially affect EGFR mutation risk by ancestry</li>
                <li>Pack-years show inverse dose-response relationship with EGFR mutations within all ancestries, indicating tobacco exposure modulates but does not eliminate ancestry effects</li>
                <li>Some small studies show unexpected patterns (e.g., Bangladeshi study male predominance) likely due to sampling variation and small sample sizes</li>

    <li>In Brazilian cohort multivariate analysis, East Asian ancestry association with EGFR mutations (OR=2.01, p=0.03) remained significant after adjusting for smoking status (never-smoker OR=5.11, p<0.0001), demonstrating statistically independent effects of ancestry and smoking. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.2" class="evidence-link">[e50.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.4" class="evidence-link">[e50.4]</a> </li>

    <li>Xinjiang Uighur vs Han comparison shows EGFR mutations significantly enriched in never-smokers in both ethnic groups (Uighur never-smokers 9/35 vs smokers 3/41, p=0.028; Han never-smokers 29/53 vs smokers 18/52, p=0.034), yet Han overall rate (44.8%) remains 3-fold higher than Uighur (15.8%, p<0.001), demonstrating ancestry and smoking are independent factors. <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.0" class="evidence-link">[e46.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Meta-analysis shows EGFR mutations substantially more frequent in never-smokers (70% never-smokers vs 41.9% smokers in one cited meta-analysis), but this enrichment occurs across all ancestries while maintaining ancestry-based differences in baseline prevalence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.4" class="evidence-link">[e56.4]</a> </li>
    <li>German/Central European cohort shows EGFR mutations enriched in never-smokers (67% of EGFR-mutant cases were never-smokers vs 33% smokers) despite overall low 4.9% frequency, while Asian cohorts show similar never-smoker enrichment despite 30-60% overall frequency. <a href="../results/extraction-result-43.html#e43.0" class="evidence-link">[e43.0]</a> </li>
    <li>French multi-ethnic cohort multivariate analysis shows never-smoking (HR for former/current smokers = 0.12 vs never, p<0.0001) and Asian ancestry (36.1% Asians vs 10.2% Caucasians) as independent predictors, with both retained in multivariate models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.1" class="evidence-link">[e15.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Indonesian cohort and other Asian studies show EGFR mutations associated with female sex and age >50 years independent of smoking (smoking data not fully reported), consistent with multiple independent demographic risk factors. <a href="../results/extraction-result-42.html#e42.0" class="evidence-link">[e42.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This represents a novel synthesis using proper epidemiological methods (multivariate adjustment, stratification) to demonstrate independence of two well-known risk factors, advancing from descriptive observations to mechanistic understanding that ancestry-linked susceptibility and smoking-related carcinogenesis operate through separate pathways.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Both the smoking-EGFR inverse association (EGFR mutations enriched in never-smokers) and the East Asian enrichment have been independently and extensively documented in hundreds of studies since the early 2000s, representing two of the most robust epidemiological associations in lung cancer genomics.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit demonstration through multivariate regression and smoking-stratified analyses that ancestry effects persist after rigorous smoking adjustment, and that ancestry-associated differences exist within never-smoker-only populations, provides novel statistical evidence that these are independent rather than confounded effects, supporting distinct biological mechanisms for each risk factor.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Universal Demographic Associations Across Ancestries</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The associations of EGFR mutations with female sex, adenocarcinoma histology, and never-smoking status are consistent across all ancestral populations studied (East Asian, European, African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, admixed), indicating these demographic risk factors operate through biological mechanisms that are independent of and additive to ancestry-specific genetic susceptibility. The direction and qualitative pattern of these associations is preserved across populations despite 3-6 fold variation in baseline EGFR mutation prevalence.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies universally across all studied populations with documented EGFR mutation data, including East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, Southeast Asian), European/Caucasian (German, French, Spanish, Turkish), African (North African, Sub-Saharan, African-American), South Asian (Indian, Pakistani), Middle Eastern (Iranian, Gulf, Levant), and admixed (Brazilian, mixed Latin American) populations. Observations hold across baseline EGFR mutation prevalence ranging from ~5% to ~75%, across adult age ranges (typically 25-85 years in studies), and across healthcare settings (hospital-based, population-based, trial cohorts). Predominantly applies to non-small cell lung cancer with emphasis on adenocarcinoma histology.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Magnitude of associations varies across populations (e.g., female OR ranging 1.5-3.5) but direction is consistent</li>
                <li>Some small studies show apparent reversals (e.g., Bangladeshi study reporting male predominance: males 23% vs females 14%) likely due to sampling variation and small sample sizes</li>
                <li>Histology association is near-absolute: adenocarcinoma shows 90-95% of EGFR mutations while squamous cell carcinoma shows <5% even in high-prevalence Asian populations</li>
                <li>Age associations show some complexity: generally higher in older adults but with some studies showing U-shaped or age-subtype interactions (e.g., exon 19 deletions more common in younger Chinese patients)</li>
                <li>Absolute frequencies differ dramatically by ancestry while preserving association patterns: e.g., Asian never-smoker females ~70-80% EGFR-mutant vs European never-smoker females ~30-40%</li>

    <li>EGFR mutations consistently enriched in females across diverse populations: Brazilian females OR=1.67 (marginal p=0.058 in multivariate), Chinese cohort female enrichment, Turkish females 23.7% vs males 8.3% (p=0.008), Moroccan females 38.4% vs males 14.5% (p<0.001), Iranian females 33.6% vs males 22.8% (p=0.003), Indian females 29.8% vs males 20.4%, Pakistani females 37% vs males 20%, French cohort females HR=3.50 (multivariate). <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.4" class="evidence-link">[e50.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-22.html#e22.0" class="evidence-link">[e22.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.0" class="evidence-link">[e55.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.0" class="evidence-link">[e56.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-192.html#e192.0" class="evidence-link">[e192.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-37.html#e37.0" class="evidence-link">[e37.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Never-smoking association consistent across populations: Brazilian never-smokers OR=5.11 (p<0.0001), Indian never-smokers 29.4% vs smokers 15.3% (p<0.001), Moroccan non-smokers 36% vs smokers 10.3% (p<0.001), Chinese multiple cohorts never-smoker enrichment, Xinjiang Uighur and Han both show never-smoker enrichment (p<0.03 for both), German never-smokers 67% of EGFR-mutant cases, MENA region meta-analysis non-smokers 31.1% vs current smokers 11.1%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-192.html#e192.0" class="evidence-link">[e192.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.5" class="evidence-link">[e55.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.0" class="evidence-link">[e46.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-43.html#e43.0" class="evidence-link">[e43.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-62.html#e62.5" class="evidence-link">[e62.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Adenocarcinoma histology strongly associated with EGFR mutations universally: Brazilian cohort predominantly adenocarcinoma among EGFR+, Chinese cohort adenocarcinoma 52.76% vs non-adenocarcinoma 26.56% (adjusted OR=2.35, p=0.007), Turkish 90.4% of EGFR-mutant cases were adenocarcinoma (19/121 adenocarcinomas vs rare in squamous), German adenocarcinoma 8.7% vs non-adenocarcinoma 1.7%, Moroccan all EGFR-mutant cases were adenocarcinoma, Indian 26% adenocarcinoma vs 3.8% squamous. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-22.html#e22.0" class="evidence-link">[e22.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-43.html#e43.0" class="evidence-link">[e43.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.0" class="evidence-link">[e55.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-192.html#e192.0" class="evidence-link">[e192.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.0" class="evidence-link">[e11.0]</a> </li>
    <li>These demographic patterns hold across populations with 6-fold variation in baseline prevalence: low-prevalence European populations (German 4.9%, French Caucasian 10.2%) show same female/never-smoker/adenocarcinoma enrichment as high-prevalence East Asian populations (Chinese 48-75%, Indonesian 61%, Japanese ~30-60%). <a href="../results/extraction-result-43.html#e43.0" class="evidence-link">[e43.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.1" class="evidence-link">[e15.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-189.html#e189.0" class="evidence-link">[e189.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-42.html#e42.0" class="evidence-link">[e42.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-191.html#e191.0" class="evidence-link">[e191.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Age associations show some consistency with variation: Chinese EGFR-mutant patients older (mean 58.3 vs 54.3 years, p=0.016), Indonesian EGFR mutations more frequent in >50 years (64.0%), though some Asian studies report median age ~57 years while Western studies report similar ages, suggesting age effect is modest and complex. <a href="../results/extraction-result-189.html#e189.0" class="evidence-link">[e189.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-42.html#e42.0" class="evidence-link">[e42.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Better performance status associated with EGFR mutations in Brazilian cohort (multivariate OR=3.94, p=0.006), consistent with clinical observation that EGFR-mutant patients often present with better functional status. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> </li>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In newly studied admixed populations with documented East Asian immigration history (e.g., Caribbean populations with Chinese/Japanese immigration, Central Asian populations with Han Chinese admixture, Pacific Islander populations with Asian contact), EGFR mutation frequency will correlate quantitatively with proportion of East Asian genetic ancestry measurable by genome-wide ancestry-informative markers.</li>
                <li>First-generation East Asian immigrants to Western countries will maintain high EGFR mutation frequencies (30-50%) similar to their countries of origin, while their environment-matched non-Asian neighbors in the same cities will show lower frequencies (10-15%), demonstrating that rapid environmental change does not eliminate ancestry effects.</li>
                <li>In Latin American countries with well-documented Japanese immigration (e.g., Peru, Brazil), lung adenocarcinoma patients with Japanese surnames or documented Japanese ancestry will show EGFR mutation frequencies intermediate between or similar to East Asian rates (30-60%) rather than general Latin American rates.</li>
                <li>Genetic ancestry analysis of African women who show unexpectedly high EGFR mutation rates (29.3% activating mutations) will not reveal increased East Asian ancestry, indicating other genetic or biological mechanisms can produce high EGFR mutation susceptibility independent of East Asian ancestry.</li>
                <li>Within multi-ethnic Asian countries (e.g., Malaysia, Singapore), ethnic Chinese patients will show higher EGFR mutation frequencies than ethnic Malay or Indian patients treated in the same hospitals using identical testing methods, controlling for smoking and other environmental exposures.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) specifically designed to identify germline variants associated with somatic EGFR mutation status (mutation+ vs mutation-) will identify one or more susceptibility loci enriched in East Asian populations with genome-wide significant associations (p<5×10⁻⁸), mediating part of the observed ancestry-prevalence relationship.</li>
                <li>Ancient DNA analysis of prehistoric East Asian populations will reveal whether putative EGFR-susceptibility alleles underwent positive selection for adaptive traits unrelated to cancer (e.g., immune function, metabolism), or whether current allele frequencies represent neutral drift or founder effects with no selective advantage.</li>
                <li>Experimental introduction of candidate East Asian ancestry-enriched germline variants into normal human bronchial epithelial cells followed by carcinogen exposure will recapitulate increased frequency of EGFR activating mutations compared to cells with alternative alleles, demonstrating causal mechanism.</li>
                <li>Multi-generational immigrant studies tracking East Asian families across 3-4 generations in Western environments will reveal whether EGFR mutation risk remains stable across generations at East Asian levels, or whether it converges toward host-population levels over multiple generations, distinguishing purely genetic from epigenetic/early-life exposure mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Comprehensive sequencing of indigenous populations geographically isolated within Asia but with distinct genetic histories from Han Chinese (e.g., Andaman Islanders, highland populations in Southeast Asia, isolated Japanese island populations) will show variable EGFR mutation frequencies that correlate with their degree of genetic similarity to major East Asian populations, mapping the geographic/genetic boundaries of the susceptibility locus.</li>
                <li>Epigenetic analysis of EGFR locus chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and histone modifications in normal lung tissue will reveal ancestry-associated differences in germline epigenetic marks that predict somatic mutation susceptibility.</li>
                <li>Analysis of East Asian populations with historically low tobacco exposure (e.g., Bhutan, Tibet) will clarify whether ancestry effects are modified by multi-generational environmental exposures or operate independently across all environmental contexts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding isolated populations with high East Asian genetic ancestry (>90%) but low EGFR mutation frequency (<15%) would challenge the ancestry-susceptibility hypothesis and suggest environmental or other genetic factors are necessary.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the Brazilian ancestry association (OR=2.01) becomes non-significant when controlling for additional socioeconomic, healthcare access, or unmeasured environmental factors would suggest confounding rather than causal genetic effects.</li>
                <li>GWAS studies with adequate power (>5,000 cases) failing to identify any germline variants associated with somatic EGFR mutation status, or finding significant variants that are not enriched in East Asian populations, would challenge the genetic susceptibility mechanism and suggest alternative explanations (e.g., environmental, stochastic).</li>
                <li>Finding that adopted East Asian children raised from infancy in non-Asian environments develop lung cancer with EGFR mutations at non-Asian rates (~10-15%) would challenge genetic ancestry hypothesis in favor of early-life environmental or cultural exposures, though this would require very long-term follow-up.</li>
                <li>Identifying specific environmental exposures (e.g., specific air pollutants, dietary factors, infectious agents) that completely abolish the East Asian vs non-Asian difference in EGFR frequency when statistically controlled would suggest environmental mechanisms dominate over genetic susceptibility.</li>
                <li>Finding that variation in EGFR mutation frequency within East Asian populations (e.g., China's range 30-55%) is better explained by regional environmental factors than by sub-population genetic structure would challenge the primacy of genetic ancestry.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the ancestry association in admixed populations disappears or reverses when using alternative ancestry estimation methods or different marker panels would suggest the observed association is a technical artifact rather than biological.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The specific molecular mechanism by which inherited genetic variants influence somatic EGFR mutation acquisition remains completely unknown - no germline susceptibility loci have been definitively identified through GWAS or candidate gene studies, and no functional variants affecting DNA repair, chromatin accessibility, or mutation rate at the EGFR locus have been characterized. <a href="../results/extraction-result-16.html#e16.2" class="evidence-link">[e16.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-34.html#e34.3" class="evidence-link">[e34.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Substantial within-East-Asia heterogeneity exists that cannot be fully explained by ancestry differences: PIONEER study showing Kinh Vietnamese 64.2% vs Indians 21.9% (both Asian), Chinese regional differences with Taiwan 55%, Guangdong patterns, Beijing patterns showing different exon 19/21 ratios, suggesting additional genetic or environmental factors beyond broad ancestry categories. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.1" class="evidence-link">[e39.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-62.html#e62.0" class="evidence-link">[e62.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.3" class="evidence-link">[e46.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.2" class="evidence-link">[e11.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Regional variation within countries showing different EGFR mutation subtype patterns (exon 19 deletions vs exon 21 L858R predominance): Taiwan shows exon 21 predominance, Guangdong shows exon 19 predominance, Beijing shows no strong difference - this exon-specific geographic pattern is not explained by ancestry alone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.3" class="evidence-link">[e46.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-79.html#e79.6" class="evidence-link">[e79.6]</a> </li>
    <li>African women show unexpectedly high EGFR mutation rates (29.3% activating mutations, 26.7% resistance mutations) comparable to Asian women rates and much higher than African men (5.2%), which cannot be explained by East Asian ancestry in this population and suggests alternative biological mechanisms for high EGFR susceptibility. <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.3" class="evidence-link">[e15.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The mechanistic basis for why EGFR mutations specifically (rather than other oncogenes like KRAS, ALK, ROS1) show strong ancestry associations remains unexplained - KRAS shows opposite patterns with higher frequency in Western populations, suggesting locus-specific rather than genome-wide mechanisms. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.2" class="evidence-link">[e39.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-191.html#e191.4" class="evidence-link">[e191.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Age-related differences in EGFR mutation subtypes within East Asian populations: Chinese studies show exon 19 deletions more common in patients <50 years vs exon 21 L858R shift in older patients (>60 years), suggesting age-dependent mutational processes not explained by ancestry. <a href="../results/extraction-result-79.html#e79.6" class="evidence-link">[e79.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Within-population variance and study-to-study heterogeneity: Turkish studies show 13-44% range despite presumably similar ancestry, Chinese studies show 30-55% range, suggesting methodological factors (testing methods, sample selection, histology mix) may explain as much variance as ancestry. <a href="../results/extraction-result-62.html#e62.6" class="evidence-link">[e62.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-22.html#e22.0" class="evidence-link">[e22.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of rare germline EGFR mutations (e.g., germline T790M, V843I, A871E) in population-level EGFR mutation frequencies is unclear - these are documented as familial susceptibility alleles but their contribution to observed ancestry differences is unknown. <a href="../results/extraction-result-16.html#e16.2" class="evidence-link">[e16.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.1" class="evidence-link">[e23.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-34.html#e34.3" class="evidence-link">[e34.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental factors hypothesized to contribute to Asian lung cancer patterns (biomass fuel exposure, cooking oil fumes, indoor air pollution, PM2.5, occupational exposures, TB history) are mentioned in multiple studies but not quantitatively linked to EGFR mutation differences across populations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.1" class="evidence-link">[e39.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.2" class="evidence-link">[e39.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-62.html#e62.5" class="evidence-link">[e62.5]</a> </li>
    <li>The specific environmental exposures (if any) that interact with genetic ancestry to produce observed EGFR mutation patterns are not identified - gene-environment interactions remain hypothetical without demonstrated specific exposures. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.2" class="evidence-link">[e39.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-62.html#e62.5" class="evidence-link">[e62.5]</a> </li>
