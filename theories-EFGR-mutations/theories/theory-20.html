                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Regional Environmental Mutagen Theory of EGFR Enrichment</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why EGFR activating mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 in lung cancer are more common in patients of East Asian descent compared to other populations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Specific environmental exposures concentrated in East and South Asian regions generate distinct mutational signatures that preferentially produce EGFR mutations through multiple mechanistic pathways. Key exposures include: (1) smoky coal combustion in specific Chinese regions (e.g., Xuanwei) creating unique carcinogen profiles with specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); (2) high-temperature cooking oil fumes (particularly from stir-frying) generating reactive aldehydes and other mutagenic compounds that produce specific DNA adducts; (3) indoor biomass burning and solid fuel combustion producing PAHs and other carcinogens with sustained high-level exposure in domestic settings; and (4) outdoor air pollution (PM2.5) with region-specific chemical composition from coal combustion and industrial sources. These exposures create mutational patterns mechanistically distinct from tobacco smoking, with different nucleotide substitution spectra and indel patterns that favor EGFR mutations over KRAS mutations. The theory predicts that whole-genome sequencing of tumors from exposed populations should reveal specific mutational signatures (SBS and ID signatures) associated with these exposures and enriched in EGFR-mutant relative to EGFR-wild-type tumors, and that these signatures should be absent or rare in Western populations. The theory further proposes that gender differences in exposure patterns (females with higher domestic cooking and indoor exposure) and sustained multi-decade exposures in specific geographic regions contribute to observed ethnic and gender differences in EGFR mutation prevalence.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Smoky Coal-Specific EGFR Mutational Signature</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Exposure to smoky coal combustion (particularly bituminous coal in specific Chinese regions like Xuanwei and parts of southwestern China) generates a unique mutational signature characterized by specific DNA adducts (PAH-DNA adducts, particularly from benzo[a]pyrene and other high-molecular-weight PAHs) that preferentially produce EGFR mutations in exons 18-21, with a distinct pattern of nucleotide substitutions (enriched for specific transversion or transition types) compared to standard tobacco smoking or other coal types. The mechanism involves formation of bulky DNA adducts at specific sequence contexts that are overrepresented in EGFR exons relative to KRAS or other driver genes.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to populations with documented sustained smoky coal exposure (primarily for heating and cooking) in specific Chinese regions (Xuanwei, parts of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces) where bituminous smoky coal is used without proper ventilation. Effect requires years to decades of high-level exposure (typically daily exposure in domestic settings). May be specific to coal types with particular chemical composition (high PAH content). Geographic scope is currently limited to documented smoky coal regions in China; generalizability to other coal types or combustion sources is uncertain. Temporal scope: effects manifest after latency periods of 10-30 years post-exposure initiation.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect may be highly specific to certain bituminous coal types with high PAH content; anthracite coal or other coal types may not produce the same signature</li>
                <li>Requires sustained high-level exposure with poor ventilation; intermittent or outdoor exposures may be insufficient</li>
                <li>May interact with genetic susceptibility factors (e.g., DNA repair gene variants, metabolic enzyme polymorphisms like CYP1A1, GSTM1)</li>
                <li>Effect may be modulated by co-exposures (tobacco smoking may mask or alter the signature)</li>
                <li>Signature may be diluted in tumors with high mutational burden from other sources</li>
                <li>Recent transition away from smoky coal in some regions may reduce future incidence with lag time</li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While smoky coal as a potent lung cancer risk factor is well-established epidemiologically, the mechanistic link to EGFR-specific mutagenesis through unique mutational signatures represents a novel hypothesis requiring validation through whole-genome sequencing studies comparing exposed and unexposed populations.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Smoky coal exposure in Xuanwei, China is an established lung cancer risk factor with documented exceptionally high incidence rates in never-smokers (>10-fold elevated).

            <h3>Statement 1: Cooking Oil Fume Mutagenic Mechanism</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> High-temperature cooking oil fumes (particularly from stir-frying and deep-frying with certain oils at temperatures >200-250°C) generate mutagenic compounds including reactive aldehydes (acrolein, crotonaldehyde), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heterocyclic amines that preferentially induce EGFR mutations through formation of specific DNA adducts. Exposure is concentrated in individuals (predominantly females in Asian populations) who perform cooking with sustained high-level exposure in poorly ventilated domestic settings. The mechanism involves inhalation of oil fume particles and vapor-phase compounds that deposit in distal airways where lung adenocarcinomas typically arise, producing DNA damage patterns that favor EGFR over KRAS mutations. This contributes to both ethnic differences (cooking practice variations) and gender differences (gendered cooking roles) in EGFR mutation prevalence.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to populations with traditional high-temperature cooking practices (stir-frying, deep-frying) using specific oils (particularly oils with low smoke points or high unsaturated fat content). Effect is most relevant to individuals with sustained domestic cooking exposure over years to decades, typically females in traditional gender-role divisions. Requires poor ventilation (enclosed kitchens without adequate exhaust systems). Effect size likely depends on cooking frequency (daily vs occasional), duration per session, oil type, cooking temperature, and ventilation quality. Geographic scope includes East Asian, South Asian, and Southeast Asian regions with traditional cooking practices. Temporal scope: effects manifest after 10-30 years of regular high-level exposure.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect may vary substantially by oil type (rapeseed oil, peanut oil, soybean oil have different mutagenic profiles when heated; some oils more mutagenic at high temperatures)</li>
                <li>Ventilation dramatically modulates exposure (modern range hoods may reduce risk; traditional enclosed kitchens without ventilation show highest effects)</li>
                <li>Cooking duration and frequency are critical dose determinants (professional cooks and restaurant workers may have even higher exposures than domestic cooking)</li>
                <li>Effect may be modified by co-exposures (environmental tobacco smoke, outdoor air pollution)</li>
                <li>Modern cooking practices with improved ventilation or different methods (microwave, steaming) may reduce exposure</li>
                <li>Occupational restaurant exposures may differ from domestic exposures in intensity and duration patterns</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the epidemiological association between cooking fumes and lung cancer is well-established, the specific EGFR-preferential mutagenic mechanism and the prediction of detectable mutational signatures represent novel hypotheses requiring validation through molecular studies comparing exposed and unexposed populations with similar ethnicity.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Cooking oil fumes are an established lung cancer risk factor in Asian never-smoker women, with strong epidemiological evidence from multiple case-control studies (odds ratios ~2-3). The association is well-documented in Chinese, Taiwanese, and other Asian populations. Chemical analysis has identified mutagenic compounds in cooking fumes.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific mechanistic proposal that cooking fumes preferentially generate EGFR mutations (rather than causing lung cancer through non-specific pathways or other driver mutations) through formation of specific DNA adducts with sequence context preferences enriched in EGFR is novel and not yet established with molecular data. The prediction of a specific mutational signature enriched in cooking-exposed populations is untested.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Indoor Biomass and Solid Fuel Combustion EGFR Association</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Indoor combustion of biomass fuels (wood, crop residues, dung) and coal for heating and cooking in poorly ventilated domestic settings generates sustained high-level exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other combustion products that contribute to EGFR mutation generation. Exposure is particularly concentrated in rural populations and lower socioeconomic groups in Asia (especially South Asia, Southeast Asia, and rural China) where traditional solid fuels remain common. Females typically have higher exposure due to time spent in domestic cooking and heating activities. The mechanism involves chronic inhalation of combustion products producing cumulative DNA damage with patterns that may favor EGFR mutations, potentially through similar pathways as smoky coal but with broader geographic distribution.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to populations using solid fuels (biomass or coal) for domestic cooking and/or heating in enclosed spaces without adequate ventilation. Predominantly affects rural and lower socioeconomic populations in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America where solid fuel use persists. Effect requires sustained multi-year to multi-decade exposure with daily or near-daily use. Females typically have 2-5 fold higher exposure than males in same households due to cooking roles. Effect size depends on fuel type (coal > wood > crop residues), combustion efficiency (traditional stoves vs improved stoves), ventilation, and daily exposure hours. Geographic scope is global but most relevant in regions with high solid fuel use (South Asia, Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Latin America). Temporal relevance: most applicable to cohorts with exposure in pre-development era; declining relevance as populations transition to clean fuels.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect varies by fuel type: coal combustion produces different carcinogen profile than biomass combustion</li>
                <li>Improved cookstoves with better combustion efficiency and ventilation substantially reduce exposure and may reduce effect</li>
                <li>Co-exposure with environmental tobacco smoke may have synergistic or antagonistic effects</li>
                <li>Genetic factors (metabolic enzymes, DNA repair capacity) likely modify individual susceptibility</li>
                <li>Transitional populations (recent switchers to clean fuels) have complex exposure histories</li>
                <li>Urban vs rural differences in fuel use create within-country exposure gradients</li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While solid fuel smoke as a lung cancer risk is established, the EGFR-specific mutagenic mechanism and its contribution to ethnic EGFR prevalence differences represent novel hypotheses. Few studies have examined EGFR mutation patterns specifically in solid fuel-exposed populations or searched for exposure-specific mutational signatures.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is an established lung cancer risk factor, recognized by IARC as a Group 1 carcinogen. Epidemiological studies have shown elevated lung cancer risk (odds ratios ~1.5-2.5) in solid fuel users, particularly for coal. The association is well-documented in Chinese and Indian populations.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific proposal that solid fuel combustion preferentially generates EGFR mutations through specific mutational mechanisms and contributes substantially to ethnic differences in EGFR prevalence is novel. The prediction that solid fuel-exposed populations should show identifiable mutational signatures enriched in EGFR-mutant tumors has not been tested. The mechanistic link between solid fuel exposure and EGFR-specific mutagenesis requires validation.</p>

            <h3>Statement 3: Outdoor Air Pollution PM2.5 EGFR Mutagenic Pathway</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Outdoor air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with region-specific chemical composition, contributes to EGFR mutation generation through sustained inhalation exposure. Asian urban areas with high PM2.5 levels (annual averages often >50-100 μg/m³ compared to WHO guideline of 5 μg/m³) and specific pollutant profiles (enriched for coal combustion products, industrial emissions including heavy metals, and secondary organic aerosols) show higher EGFR-mutant lung cancer rates even in never-smokers. The mechanism involves chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in distal airways, combined with DNA damage from PAHs, metals, and reactive oxygen species associated with PM2.5, producing cumulative mutational burden with patterns potentially favoring EGFR over KRAS. The effect requires sustained multi-year to multi-decade exposure to elevated PM2.5 levels.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to populations with documented sustained exposure to elevated outdoor PM2.5 levels (typically >35-50 μg/m³ annual average for substantial effects). Most relevant in rapidly industrializing Asian regions (Eastern China, Northern India, parts of Southeast Asia) with coal-dependent energy systems and/or heavy traffic pollution. Effect requires prolonged exposure (typically 10-30 years) to manifest. Effect size likely depends not just on PM2.5 concentration but on specific chemical composition (source contributions from coal combustion, traffic, industry). Population-level effects may be modest compared to smoking but could contribute to baseline differences between regions. Urban vs rural gradients within countries provide natural experiments. Temporal relevance: most applicable to cohorts with exposure during high-pollution periods; future cohorts may show reduced effects if air quality improves.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect likely depends critically on PM2.5 chemical composition, not just mass concentration; coal-combustion-enriched PM2.5 may differ from traffic-dominated PM2.5</li>
                <li>May interact synergistically with smoking; effects in never-smokers may differ from smokers</li>
                <li>Genetic susceptibility factors (antioxidant enzymes, DNA repair capacity) likely modify individual risk</li>
                <li>Recent rapid air quality improvements in some regions (e.g., China post-2013) may show reduced effects in future cohorts with lag time</li>
                <li>Indoor time and air filtration use modulate actual exposure even at high ambient levels</li>
                <li>Occupational outdoor exposures (traffic police, construction workers) may differ from general population</li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While air pollution-lung cancer associations are well-established, the EGFR-specific mechanism is an emerging area with some suggestive but limited evidence. The mechanistic proposal through mutational signatures and contribution to ethnic differences represents novel hypotheses requiring further validation through comprehensive genomic studies comparing high- and low-pollution regions with appropriate controls for ethnicity and smoking.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Outdoor air pollution (PM2.5) is an established lung cancer risk factor, classified as Group 1 carcinogen by IARC (2013). Large cohort studies have shown dose-response relationships between PM2.5 exposure and lung cancer incidence (hazard ratios ~1.1-1.2 per 10 μg/m³ increase). The association with lung cancer in never-smokers is documented.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific proposal that air pollution preferentially generates EGFR mutations (rather than causing lung cancer through non-specific pathways) and contributes substantially to ethnic differences in EGFR prevalence represents emerging but not yet definitively established science. Recent studies (e.g., Deng et al. 2020) have begun to examine EGFR-specific associations with air pollution, but mechanistic validation through mutational signature analysis is limited. The prediction that specific mutational signatures associated with PM2.5 exposure should be enriched in EGFR-mutant tumors is novel and testable.</p>

            <h3>Statement 4: Environmental Mutational Signature Distinctiveness and EGFR Enrichment</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Non-tobacco environmental mutagens prevalent in Asian populations (smoky coal, cooking fumes, biomass smoke, PM2.5) create distinct, identifiable whole-genome mutational signatures (patterns of single base substitutions [SBS] and insertion/deletion [ID] events with specific trinucleotide context preferences and strand biases) that are enriched in EGFR-mutant tumors relative to EGFR-wild-type tumors when comparing populations with similar ethnicity. These signatures should differ from established tobacco signatures (SBS4, SBS29, SBS92) in their trinucleotide context distribution and should be detectable through computational deconvolution of whole-genome sequencing data. Furthermore, these signatures should correlate with documented exposures (geographic proxies, questionnaire data) and should be more prevalent in Asian populations with high environmental exposures compared to Western populations or Asian populations with lower exposures. The signatures may partially overlap with signatures associated with oxidative stress, PAH exposure, or bulky DNA adduct formation, but should show distinct enrichment patterns in EGFR regulatory or coding regions.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing studies with sufficient sample sizes (typically >50-100 tumors per group) and appropriate computational methods for signature extraction and deconvolution. Requires comparison across populations with documented differential exposures but similar genetic ancestry to control for inherited factors. Signatures may be most detectable in never-smoker populations where tobacco signatures do not dominate. Requires high-quality sequencing data with adequate coverage and appropriate mutation calling pipelines. Geographic scope includes regions with documented high environmental exposures and suitable comparison populations. Detection power depends on signature strength (mutations per tumor attributable to exposure), exposure prevalence, and background mutational noise.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Signatures may be masked or diluted by dominant tobacco signatures in smokers; never-smoker populations provide clearest test cases</li>
                <li>Requires large sample sizes (typically >50-100 per group) to detect subtle signatures with statistical confidence</li>
                <li>Some signatures may be shared across multiple exposure types (e.g., PAH signatures from coal, cooking, and air pollution may partially overlap)</li>
                <li>Signature detection depends on mutational signature computational methods; different algorithms may give different results</li>
                <li>Tumors with very high mutational burden from other sources may dilute exposure-specific signatures</li>
                <li>Signatures may vary in strength across tumor types or genomic regions</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While mutational signature frameworks and some never-smoker lung cancer signature studies exist, the specific integrated hypothesis linking Asian environmental exposures to EGFR enrichment through identifiable mutational signatures represents a novel synthesis requiring systematic validation through well-designed genomic studies with appropriate exposure assessment and population comparisons.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Mutational signature analysis is an established computational method for identifying carcinogenic exposures, pioneered by Alexandrov and Stratton. Tobacco smoking signatures (SBS4, SBS29, SBS92) are well-characterized in lung cancer. Some studies have examined mutational signatures in never-smoker lung cancer and found differences from smokers, including signatures of unknown etiology.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific prediction that Asian environmental exposures (cooking fumes, smoky coal, biomass smoke, PM2.5) create distinct, identifiable signatures that are (1) enriched in EGFR-mutant relative to EGFR-wild-type tumors and (2) explain substantial portions of ethnic EGFR prevalence differences represents a novel, testable hypothesis. Comprehensive studies comparing Asian and Western never-smoker lung cancer mutational signatures with stratification by EGFR status and documented environmental exposures have not been performed. The mechanistic proposal that these signatures preferentially affect EGFR due to sequence context or regional preferences is novel.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whole-genome sequencing of EGFR-mutant vs EGFR-wild-type lung adenocarcinomas in Asian never-smokers should reveal specific mutational signatures (SBS and/or ID patterns) enriched in EGFR-mutant cases that differ from established tobacco signatures.</li>
                <li>Within Asian populations, never-smoker females with documented high cooking-related exposure (based on detailed questionnaires about cooking frequency, duration, oil types, and ventilation) should show higher EGFR mutation rates than never-smoker females with minimal cooking exposure, after controlling for other factors.</li>
                <li>Populations from Xuanwei or other documented smoky coal-use regions in China should show distinct EGFR mutation spectra (exon distribution, specific variant types) and/or mutational signatures compared to other Chinese populations without smoky coal exposure.</li>
                <li>In regions undergoing rapid air quality improvement (e.g., Chinese cities with major PM2.5 reductions post-2013), lung cancer cohorts diagnosed 10-20 years after improvements should show reduced EGFR mutation prevalence compared to cohorts with exposure during high-pollution periods, particularly in never-smokers.</li>
                <li>Environmental exposure biomarkers (urinary PAH metabolites, DNA adducts measured in blood or buccal cells) measured in prospective cohorts should show positive correlations with subsequent EGFR-mutant lung cancer risk in never-smokers.</li>
                <li>Meta-analysis of EGFR prevalence in solid fuel-using populations (biomass or coal) vs non-users within the same country/ethnicity should show elevated EGFR prevalence in solid fuel users, particularly for females with high domestic exposure.</li>
                <li>Geographic variation in EGFR prevalence within China should correlate with historical PM2.5 exposure levels (from satellite-based estimates or monitoring networks), even after accounting for smoking prevalence.</li>
                <li>Immigrant studies comparing lung cancer in Asian immigrants to Western countries (with lower environmental exposures) to those remaining in high-exposure Asian regions should show convergence of EGFR prevalence toward Western levels after multiple decades, with the rate of change informing exposure timing effects.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If ultra-high-resolution mutational signature analysis (using machine learning approaches with large samples) were performed comparing Asian and Western EGFR-mutant never-smoker tumors, and revealed identical signatures with no enrichment of environmental exposure signatures in Asian cases, this would strongly challenge the environmental mutagen theory and suggest other mechanisms (genetic, endogenous processes) dominate.</li>
                <li>If experimental exposure models (organoid cultures or mouse models using Asian ethnic background cell lines/strains) with specific environmental mutagens (cooking fume condensates, smoky coal combustion products, PM2.5 extracts) were performed and failed to generate EGFR mutations preferentially over other genes, this would challenge the mechanistic causal pathway.</li>
                <li>If large-scale prospective cohorts with detailed exposure assessment (cooking practices, residential air pollution, solid fuel use) followed for decades showed no association between these exposures and EGFR-mutant lung cancer risk after controlling for ethnicity and smoking, this would challenge the theory's core predictions.</li>
                <li>If gene-environment interaction analysis (testing interactions between environmental exposures and germline variants in DNA repair, metabolic enzymes, EGFR itself) showed that environmental exposures only increase EGFR mutation risk in very rare genetic backgrounds (<5% of population), this would limit the theory's generalizability and suggest genetic factors dominate.</li>
                <li>If comprehensive mutational signature analysis revealed that Asian-specific signatures exist but are equally common in EGFR-mutant and EGFR-wild-type tumors (no enrichment), this would refute the EGFR-preferential mechanism and suggest environmental exposures cause lung cancer through other driver genes.</li>
                <li>If temporal trend analysis showed that EGFR prevalence has remained stable or increased in Asian countries despite major reductions in specific environmental exposures (e.g., decline in solid fuel use, air quality improvements), this would challenge the environmental theory and suggest other factors drive the ethnic differences.</li>
                <li>If the proposed environmental signatures were found to be equally common in Western never-smoker lung cancers, this would suggest the exposures are not geographically restricted or that other mechanisms create similar signatures, weakening the ethnic difference explanation.</li>
                <li>If advanced DNA adduct analysis (using mass spectrometry or sequencing-based methods) showed no difference in adduct types or levels between EGFR-mutant and EGFR-wild-type tumors from the same exposed population, this would challenge the exposure-EGFR mechanism link.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating through whole-genome sequencing that Asian and Western EGFR-mutant never-smoker tumors have statistically indistinguishable mutational signatures (same SBS and ID profiles) would strongly challenge the distinct environmental mutagen hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Finding through epidemiological studies that populations with very high exposure to proposed mutagens (cooking fumes, solid fuels, air pollution) but different ethnicity (e.g., African populations with high biomass smoke exposure, or Middle Eastern populations with high air pollution) do not show elevated EGFR mutation rates comparable to East Asians would challenge the sufficiency of environmental exposures alone.</li>
                <li>Showing through prospective cohort studies with detailed exposure assessment that environmental exposure biomarkers (PAH metabolites, DNA adducts) do not correlate with EGFR-mutant lung cancer risk within ethnically homogeneous populations would challenge the causal link.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating through experimental studies (in vitro or in vivo models) that proposed environmental mutagens (cooking fume condensates, coal combustion products, PM2.5 organic extracts) do not generate EGFR mutations preferentially when applied to human lung cells would challenge the mechanistic pathway.</li>
                <li>Finding through temporal trend analysis that EGFR mutation prevalence has not declined in cohorts with substantially reduced exposure to proposed mutagens (following clean air policies, cooking practice changes, fuel transitions) after appropriate latency periods would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Showing through within-Asian geographic comparisons that regions with dramatically different environmental exposures (e.g., urban high-pollution vs rural low-pollution areas, or coastal vs inland regions) show no difference in EGFR mutation prevalence after controlling for smoking and other factors would challenge the environmental hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating through immigrant studies that Asian migrants to low-exposure Western countries continue to show East Asian-level EGFR prevalence even after multiple decades of low exposure would challenge the importance of adult environmental exposures and suggest early-life, genetic, or other factors dominate.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The specific molecular mechanisms by which proposed mutagens would preferentially generate EGFR mutations over KRAS or other driver mutations (e.g., sequence context preferences, DNA adduct distribution, repair pathway interactions) are not established at the mechanistic level. <a href="../results/extraction-result-341.html#e341.0" class="evidence-link">[e341.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-296.html#e296.0" class="evidence-link">[e296.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Quantitative dose-response relationships between specific exposure levels (e.g., cooking hours per day, PM2.5 concentration-years, coal use duration) and EGFR mutation rates are not established; most evidence is qualitative presence/absence of exposure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-341.html#e341.6" class="evidence-link">[e341.6]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not adequately explain why environmental exposures would differentially affect the ratio of exon 19 deletions vs exon 21 L858R mutations, which varies across populations and studies (some studies report exon 19 predominance, others exon 21 predominance). <a href="../results/extraction-result-300.html#e300.0" class="evidence-link">[e300.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-300.html#e300.1" class="evidence-link">[e300.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Direct mutational signature data from comprehensive whole-genome sequencing studies linking proposed specific environmental exposures to EGFR mutations are very limited; most evidence is indirect inference from epidemiological associations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-296.html#e296.0" class="evidence-link">[e296.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-347.html#e347.0" class="evidence-link">[e347.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory has difficulty explaining substantial ethnic differences observed within the same geographic region and presumably similar environmental exposures (e.g., Han vs Uighur 44.8% vs 15.8% in same Xinjiang region; North vs South Indian differences). <a href="../results/extraction-result-300.html#e300.0" class="evidence-link">[e300.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-316.html#e316.5" class="evidence-link">[e316.5]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain the very high EGFR prevalence in some East Asian never-smoker females (60-75% in multiple studies) solely through environmental exposures, as some unexposed females also show elevated rates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-347.html#e347.0" class="evidence-link">[e347.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-350.html#e350.0" class="evidence-link">[e350.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-348.html#e348.0" class="evidence-link">[e348.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Hormonal and endocrine factors (progesterone receptor, aromatase expression mentioned in reviews) as potential contributors to female predominance and ethnic differences are not integrated into environmental exposure framework. <a href="../results/extraction-result-341.html#e341.0" class="evidence-link">[e341.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Potential gene-environment interactions (e.g., DNA repair capacity, metabolic enzyme polymorphisms that modify environmental carcinogen effects) are proposed but not systematically characterized for EGFR-specific outcomes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-341.html#e341.0" class="evidence-link">[e341.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of other regional endemic exposures mentioned in reviews (e.g., tuberculosis and other endemic infectious lung diseases mentioned as regional risk factors) is not addressed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-334.html#e334.1" class="evidence-link">[e334.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Radon exposure mentioned as a domestic exposure particularly affecting females is not integrated into the theory framework. <a href="../results/extraction-result-341.html#e341.0" class="evidence-link">[e341.0]</a> </li>
