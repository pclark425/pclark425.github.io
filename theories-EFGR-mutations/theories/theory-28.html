                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Testing technology and selection amplify perceived East Asian EGFR excess and obscure rare variant landscapes</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why activating EGFR mutations in lung cancer are more common in East Asian populations, and how this relates to responsiveness to EGFR kinase inhibitors, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Historical reliance on limited-scope assays (ARMS, exons 19/21-only Sanger) and selective testing workflows have inflated apparent differences in EGFR prevalence and masked uncommon/compound alleles, particularly in settings where East Asian cohorts were enriched for never-smokers and adenocarcinoma with incomplete or retrospective testing. Broad NGS and reflex testing reduce these artifacts and reveal a residual biological difference.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Limited-scope assays under-detect uncommon/compound EGFR variants; NGS expands detection</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Assays targeting only canonical hotspots (e.g., exon 19 deletions and L858R) systematically under-detect exon 18/20 and compound EGFR variants, depressing observed prevalence of uncommon alleles; adoption of broad NGS reduces false negatives and shifts the observed subtype spectrum.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Clinical molecular diagnostics for NSCLC across health systems; applies to series using ARMS-PCR kits or exon-restricted Sanger vs comprehensive NGS panels; all ancestries.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Some advanced ARMS panels include selected rare targets, partially mitigating under-detection.</li>
                <li>Low tumor purity or ultra-low VAF subclones can evade detection even with NGS without adequate depth.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

            <h3>Statement 1: Selective and optional testing inflates EGFR-positive fractions in East Asian trial subgroups</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Optional or retrospective EGFR testing with low evaluable rates and enrichment for never-smoker, adenocarcinoma phenotypes inflates observed EGFR-positive proportions in East Asian trial subgroups relative to unselected populations.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Clinical trials and hospital-based series with non-mandatory or retrospective molecular testing; primarily first-line studies in never-smoker East Asian populations.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Mandatory, population-based testing with prespecified assay platforms attenuates this inflation.</li>
                <li>Biopsy size limitations can further bias who becomes testable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Phase 2 and phase 3 East Asian trials with optional testing had EGFR status evaluable in small fractions (≤~31%), yet high EGFR-positive rates (61–68%). <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.1" class="evidence-link">[e409.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.2" class="evidence-link">[e409.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Review highlights optional/retrospective testing, low tissue submission, and high unevaluable rates as sources of bias. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.0" class="evidence-link">[e409.0]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 2: Residual biological/epidemiologic difference persists after harmonization</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Even accounting for assay and selection biases, multiple East Asian cohorts with broad testing report high EGFR prevalence, indicating a residual biological/epidemiologic difference likely tied to exposure patterns and case-mix.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Population and hospital cohorts in East Asia using exon 18–21 sequencing or broad panels; adenocarcinoma-enriched series.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Hospital-based cohorts can still deviate from population averages; true population estimates require registry-based surveillance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Chinese and Japanese cohorts report ~43–49% EGFR prevalence in NSCLC/adenocarcinoma with targeted sequencing; large reviews cite ~4× Asian vs Western difference (~40% vs ~10–20%). <a href="../results/extraction-result-382.html#e382.0" class="evidence-link">[e382.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-389.html#e389.0" class="evidence-link">[e389.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-380.html#e380.0" class="evidence-link">[e380.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.0" class="evidence-link">[e411.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-393.html#e393.0" class="evidence-link">[e393.0]</a> </li>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Transitioning diagnostic workflows from ARMS/exon-limited testing to hybrid-capture NGS in East Asian centers will increase detection of uncommon/compound mutations and modestly decrease the apparent fraction of classical exon 19/L858R among EGFR-positive cases.</li>
                <li>Prospective trials with mandatory, harmonized NGS testing and high tissue adequacy will yield lower Asian–Western differences in EGFR prevalence than retrospective/optional-testing eras, though a residual difference will remain.</li>
                <li>Re-testing historical ARMS-negative adenocarcinomas with NGS will uncover a non-trivial proportion of missed uncommon/compound EGFR variants.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>After full harmonization of assays and selection across global registries, the true Asian vs Western EGFR prevalence ratio will fall below two-fold (vs. historically cited four-fold) if ascertainment accounts for most of the gap.</li>
                <li>The proportion of compound EGFR mutations will be higher in regions that widely adopted NGS earlier, independent of true biology, revealing a strong detection-time artifact.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If broad NGS adoption does not increase uncommon/compound EGFR detection rates relative to ARMS-era baselines, the under-detection premise would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If mandatory, harmonized testing in parallel Asian and Western cohorts shows identical EGFR prevalence, then prior differences were entirely ascertainment-driven, challenging claims of residual biological difference.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>True population-level frequencies for many rare/compound EGFR variants remain unknown due to scarcity of registry-scale NGS data stratified by ancestry and exposure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.2" class="evidence-link">[e411.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-411.html#e411.4" class="evidence-link">[e411.4]</a> </li>
