                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why EGFR activating mutations in exons 18-21 in lung cancer are more common in East Asian populations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Admixed populations, such as Brazilians, Hispanics, Indians, and American Indigenous groups, demonstrate EGFR mutation frequencies in lung cancer that quantitatively scale with the proportion of East Asian (or Native American, genetically proximate) ancestry in the patient's genome, independent of self-reported ethnicity, geography, environment, and lifestyle factors such as smoking. The EGFR mutation prevalence in these groups thus reflects an admixture-driven, quantitative, genetically determined effect modifiable by local founder events or environmental exposures.</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: Quantitative Ancestry-Driven Admixture Law for EGFR</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In lung adenocarcinoma, the prevalence of activating EGFR mutations exhibits a monotonic relationship to the proportion of East Asian and/or Native American ancestry in an individual's genome. This scaling can be modeled as linear or log-linear within certain admixture ranges, and persists even after controlling for environmental and lifestyle factors such as smoking, sex, and socioeconomic status. Self-reported race or ethnicity does not reliably predict EGFR mutation prevalence compared to quantitative ancestry.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to admixed or ancestrally heterogeneous populations (Latin America, Brazil, US Hispanics, South Asia, Caribbean, North Africa, American Indigenous, and any admixed urban population), specifically for non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and is robust to typical urban/rural migration and agnostic to location of residence (i.e., persists after migration).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Local founder effects or unique historical events (e.g., isolated Peruvian or Kinh Vietnamese founder populations) may cause deviations from the admixture-predicted frequency.</li>
                <li>Recent, or unrecognized, admixture (Asian/Native American/other) may bias local estimates.</li>
                <li>At very high (>50%) or very low (<5%) ancestry proportions, the relationship may become nonlinear or plateau.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Brazilian series: High Asian ancestry by AIM-INDEL panel strongly predicts EGFR mutation prevalence, whereas self-reported race does not; logistic regression shows OR = 2.01 for top versus bottom tercile of Asian ancestry (p=0.03), unaffected by smoking, sex, or performance status. <a href="../results/extraction-result-130.html#e130.1" class="evidence-link">[e130.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Large US clinico-genomic dataset: both East Asian (EAS) and Admixed American (AMR, high Native American) genetic fractions are independently associated with increased EGFR driver frequency in LUAD, even after smoking adjustment; OncoKB actionable variant association for Hispanic/Latino (OR=1.04, p=0.003). African ancestry has an inverse association. <a href="../results/extraction-result-140.html#e140.0" class="evidence-link">[e140.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-170.html#e170.0" class="evidence-link">[e170.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Latin American and Peruvian studies: Wide inter-country EGFR frequency variation in Latin America (e.g., 11% in Argentina, 67% in Peru) tracks with patterns of Asian/Native American ancestry, not self-ID ethnicity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-162.html#e162.1" class="evidence-link">[e162.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.0" class="evidence-link">[e183.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Indian and North African series: Intermediate EGFR frequencies (20–25%) match the known regional admixture (historical Middle Eastern, Central Asian, European influence in India; admixed populations in North Africa). <a href="../results/extraction-result-209.html#e209.0" class="evidence-link">[e209.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.1" class="evidence-link">[e157.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-150.html#e150.1" class="evidence-link">[e150.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-180.html#e180.0" class="evidence-link">[e180.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.0" class="evidence-link">[e183.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Ancestry-informative marker (AIM) and 1000 Genomes continental allele frequency reference studies show significant differences in risk allele frequencies at EGFR-associated loci between EAS and EUR/AFR/AMR populations, consistent with a population-genetic basis for ethnic/continental EGFR frequency differences. <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.2" class="evidence-link">[e161.2]</a> </li>
    <li>US Foundation CDx–stratified dataset: East Asian genetic ancestry group has ~4x higher EGFR frequency versus European ancestry (50.3% vs 13%); gradients persist in US-based populations, supporting ancestry effect over geography. <a href="../results/extraction-result-170.html#e170.0" class="evidence-link">[e170.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Brazilian cohort: Ancestry admixture fraction (ASN/Asian) robustly outperforms self-reported race in predicting EGFR mutational status (no independent effect of self-ID race, African, European, or Amerindian ancestry in multivariate model). <a href="../results/extraction-result-130.html#e130.1" class="evidence-link">[e130.1]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Population genetics established admixture modeling for many complex traits and diseases, but quantitative prediction of EGFR mutational prevalence from ancestry fractions—especially with clinical implications—has not been formalized. This law advances and generalizes the field.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> A few single-country studies (notably Leal 2018 in Brazil, Carrot-Zhang 2020 in Latin America) document ancestry associations with EGFR mutation. Admixture models are established in complex trait genetics broadly but have not been quantitatively applied and validated for EGFR mutation prevalence in clinical cancer epidemiology.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law synthesizes multi-population quantitative evidence into a general scaling law that predicts EGFR prevalence from genome-wide ancestry, formalizing and generalizing admixture-driven mutational epidemiology. It also proposes that ancestry-based modeling outperforms self-identification and region for clinical risk prediction.</p>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>EGFR mutation prevalence in Caribbean and African-American populations will increase in direct proportion to East Asian/Native American ancestry fractions, even after controlling for geography, sex, and smoking.</li>
                <li>In future large, well-phenotyped US or Latin American lung cancer cohorts, ancestry-informative marker–based genetic ancestry will be a stronger predictor of EGFR mutation status than self-reported ethnicity.</li>
                <li>Retrospective multi-trial analyses incorporating SNP-based ancestry, rather than race, will reveal that unexplained variation in EGFR+ case prevalence within the same racial group is explained by local admixture.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Admixture scaling may exhibit saturation, threshold, or nonlinearity at very high or very low Asian/Native American proportions, especially in genetically homogenous founder populations.</li>
                <li>If applied to as-yet-unstudied populations (Pacific Islanders, Filipino-Americans, or Native Americans in Alaska), admixture-based models will predict local EGFR prevalence—but the accuracy in these groups is presently untested.</li>
                <li>Intervention on region-specific admixture (e.g., voluntary population relocation experiments or long-term cohort tracking) will show that prevalence remains stable despite environmental change, unless genetic ancestry composition is altered.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstration that low-admixture populations have EGFR mutation rates equal to or higher than high-admixture populations, when ancestry is accurately measured and confounds are controlled.</li>
                <li>Finding that intensive modeling with environmental/lifestyle factors (smoking, hormone exposure, air pollution) fully explains EGFR mutation differences with no independent effect of ancestry in multi-ethnic settings.</li>
                <li>A large, well-powered study finds that self-reported ethnic identity outperforms genomic ancestry in predicting EGFR mutation status after adjusting for confounders.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Extremely high or low prevalence in some outlier populations (e.g., high EGFR frequency in Peru, Kinh Vietnamese, or some other under-sampled groups) not fully explained by admixture; such anomalies may reflect founder effects, selection, or cryptic population structure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-162.html#e162.1" class="evidence-link">[e162.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.0" class="evidence-link">[e157.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-170.html#e170.0" class="evidence-link">[e170.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Some intrapopulation or regional variability is likely driven by as-yet-unmeasured local founder mutations or rare environmental exposures not captured by ancestry. <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.0" class="evidence-link">[e183.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-151.html#e151.0" class="evidence-link">[e151.0]</a> </li>
