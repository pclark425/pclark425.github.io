                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Inflammation–promotion model for East Asian excess of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why activating EGFR mutations in lung cancer are more common in East Asian populations, and how this relates to responsiveness to EGFR kinase inhibitors, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> EGFR-mutant clones exist at low frequency in histologically normal lung epithelia. Regional differences in exposure to ambient and indoor particulate air pollution (notably PM2.5 and cooking/coal fumes) act predominantly as promoters (via macrophage recruitment and IL-1β inflammatory signaling) that expand these pre-existing EGFR-mutant alveolar type II clones into clinically apparent adenocarcinoma. This promotion-first pathway is most visible in never-smoker strata (particularly women) where tobacco-driven KRAS pathways are less prevalent, producing a higher fraction of EGFR-mutant tumors in East Asian clinical series. Therapeutic sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs is determined by mutation status/subtype rather than ethnicity; East Asia’s higher eligible fraction scales the population-level TKI impact.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: PM2.5/indoor particulates promote EGFR-mutant clonal outgrowth via IL-1β</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In regions with higher PM2.5 and indoor particulate exposure, incidence of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma increases because pollutant-induced macrophage recruitment and IL-1β signaling promote outgrowth of pre-existing oncogenic EGFR clones in alveolar type II cells.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Population-level etiology of lung adenocarcinoma in never-smokers and light smokers in regions with materially different PM2.5/indoor particulate burdens (East Asia vs lower-PM regions). Does not make claims about squamous histology or heavy smokers where tobacco mutagenesis dominates.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In heavy smokers, tobacco-associated mutagenesis and KRAS-driven pathways can dominate; the relative contribution of PM2.5 promotion to EGFR-mutant incidence is attenuated.</li>
                <li>At very low PM2.5/indoor particulate exposure with otherwise similar demographics, regional differences in EGFR-mutant fractions should narrow.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Mechanistic and epidemiologic support: air pollution (PM2.5) correlates with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma across England, Korea, Taiwan, and Canada; mouse models show macrophage recruitment and IL-1β drive promotion; anti–IL-1β reduces tumor formation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-408.html#e408.1" class="evidence-link">[e408.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Narrative synthesis: East Asia bears heavy PM burdens; multiple cohorts link PM to lung cancer risk; review notes EGFR-mutant associations and mechanistic promotion via IL-1β. <a href="../results/extraction-result-408.html#e408.0" class="evidence-link">[e408.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Epidemiologic context for never-smokers in East Asia: elevated lung cancer rates in never-smoking women and discussion of indoor inhalants (cooking fumes, household coal, secondhand smoke) as candidate etiologies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-417.html#e417.0" class="evidence-link">[e417.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-385.html#e385.0" class="evidence-link">[e385.0]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 1: High EGFR-mutant fractions in East Asian never-smokers are a signature of promotion-first carcinogenesis</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Never-smoker East Asian lung adenocarcinoma cohorts typically show EGFR mutation fractions ≥60%, consistent with a non-tobacco, promoter-dominant pathway that favors EGFR-driven oncogenesis.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Surgically resected or trial-enrolled never-smoker East Asian lung adenocarcinoma cohorts with adequate tissue for genotyping; primarily exons 18–21 profiling.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Optional testing and small biopsies can bias estimates downward; where evaluable, the fraction remains high.</li>
                <li>Operability selection can modestly alter proportions, but high prevalence persists across settings.</li>

            <h3>Statement 2: EGFR-TKI benefit is mutation-driven across ancestries; ethnicity scales eligible population size</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Given an activating EGFR mutation, first- to third-generation EGFR-TKIs confer major benefit irrespective of ethnicity. Ethnicity modulates the population-level impact by altering the proportion of mutation-positive patients.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations (classical exon 19 deletions and L858R; selected uncommon variants), across Asian and Western clinical settings.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Uncommon/compound mutations exhibit heterogeneous sensitivity; generation-specific TKI choice and CNS penetration matter.</li>
                <li>EGFR-negative patients (even in East Asian cohorts) may do worse on first-line EGFR-TKIs than on chemotherapy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

    <li>Korean cohort: response rate 90% in EGFR-mutant vs 9% in wild-type under EGFR-TKIs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-370.html#e370.0" class="evidence-link">[e370.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Korean male smokers with squamous histology: all EGFR-mutant cases responded to gefitinib (3/3), reinforcing mutation-driven benefit beyond typical demographics. <a href="../results/extraction-result-377.html#e377.0" class="evidence-link">[e377.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In East Asian never-smokers, EGFR-negative tumors had inferior PFS on gefitinib monotherapy vs chemotherapy followed by gefitinib. <a href="../results/extraction-result-409.html#e409.2" class="evidence-link">[e409.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Interpretive emphasis; core causal statement (mutation → benefit) is well established.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Consensus across trials that EGFR mutation predicts TKI benefit regardless of ancestry.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Explicitly reframing perceived ethnicity–treatment links as eligibility fraction effects rather than intrinsic ethnic pharmacobiology.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Within a single metropolitan area, never-smokers residing in neighborhoods with higher modeled PM2.5 exposure will show a higher fraction of EGFR-mutant adenocarcinoma than those in lower-exposure neighborhoods, after adjusting for age/sex.</li>
                <li>Following regional PM2.5 reductions (e.g., coal-to-gas transitions) in East Asia, the EGFR-mutant fraction among never-smoker adenocarcinoma cases will decline with a 5–15 year lag, more than the KRAS-mutant fraction.</li>
                <li>Indoor air-quality interventions (e.g., vented hoods, clean fuels) implemented among East Asian women will be followed by a relative decline in EGFR-mutant lung cancer incidence compared with non-EGFR-mutant incidence.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Anti–IL-1β chemoprevention among high-PM-exposed East Asian never-smokers will reduce the incidence of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma versus placebo over long follow-up.</li>
                <li>Ultra-deep sequencing of normal lung from high-PM East Asian donors versus lower-PM Western donors will reveal similar per-cell EGFR driver mutation frequencies but larger EGFR-mutant clonal expansions (higher VAF clusters) in the high-PM group.</li>
                <li>Personal-exposure PM2.5 monitoring will show that cumulative exposure indices predict the EGFR-mutant fraction within never-smoker incident cases better than ambient station-level averages.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If, after rigorous adjustment for personal PM2.5/indoor particulate exposure and smoking, East Asian and Western never-smokers show identical EGFR-mutant fractions, the promotion hypothesis would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If blocking IL-1β in EGFR-mutant mouse models exposed to PM2.5 does not reduce tumor formation, the proposed promotion mechanism would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If normal lungs from high-PM East Asian donors do not show larger EGFR-mutant clonal expansions than low-PM donors, a promotion-first clonal expansion model would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Familial predisposition from rare germline EGFR variants (e.g., T790M, V843I, P848L) that can drive EGFR-dependent tumors independent of PM exposure; these events are rare and poorly quantified by ancestry. <a href="../results/extraction-result-405.html#e405.0" class="evidence-link">[e405.0]</a> </li>
    <li>EGFR-activating mutations are rare in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Central Asia despite high environmental PAH exposures, highlighting histology-specificity of EGFR mutation biology. <a href="../results/extraction-result-373.html#e373.0" class="evidence-link">[e373.0]</a> </li>
