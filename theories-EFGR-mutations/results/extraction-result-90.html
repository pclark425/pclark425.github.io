                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers in a Multiethnic Malaysian Patient Population</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide including Malaysia (Parkin et al, 2005; National Cancer Registry, Malaysia, 2006). In Malaysia, lung cancer accounts for 13.8% of all cancers in males and 3.8% of all cancers in females (National Cancer Registry, Malaysia, 2006) and is the leading cause of cancer death in men and ranks fifth overall in women (Department of Statistics, Malaysia, 2006). Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histologies (adeno-, squamous celland largecell carcinoma) account for 80-85% of all lung cancers (Jemal et al., 2006). In recent years, the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma has increased at the expense of squamous cell carcinoma worldwide and in Malaysia (Rivera et al., 2001; Liam et al., 2006). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway has been identified as a therapeutic target in lung cancer (Herbst et al., 2008). The finding that ‘classical’ activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase</p>
