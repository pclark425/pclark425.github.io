                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Evolving therapeutic landscape of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> : Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Over the past two decades, the classification of lung cancer has significantly evolved. Today, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consists of various molecular oncogenic subsets that impact both prognosis and disease management. EGFR is the first targeted oncogenic alteration identified in 2004. Since then, nearly two decades of research have enabled scientists to understand its biological function and to identify and often overcome the molecular basis of acquired resistance mechanisms to EGFR-TKIs. This article reviews the role of EGFR in NSCLC and the research progress of EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer, discussing potential treatment strategies for drug resistance to improve survival and achieve precision drug use.</p>
