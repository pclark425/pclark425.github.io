                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Risk Factors for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) Gene Mutations in Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients at Arifin Achmad Hospital, Riau Province</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background: Lung cancer is the first cause of oncological death worldwide. Guidelines made by various cancer associations, including PDPI-IASTO, regarding NSCLC recommend that all advanced stages of NSCLC undergo target genetic testing, such as EGFR mutations. The incidence of EGFR mutations in Asian populations is quite high. Methods: This was a retrospective observational analytic study with a cross-sectional study design. Results: The most unmodifiable risk factors were age ≥45 years (81.4%), male sex (70.6%), location of lung cancer on the right (52.9%), cancer size of ≥5 cm (100%), M1a metastases (57.8%), and no family history of malignancy (97.1%). The smoking status (ex-smoker) ( P =0.022; OR=4.3; 95% CI=1.24-15.57), sex (male) ( P =0.007; OR=3.409; 95% CI=1.406-8.268), and metastatic status (M1a) ( P =0.025; OR=0.203; 95% CI=0.05-0.821) were the dominant risk factors that affected the incidence of EGFR mutations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma at Arifin Achmad Hospital. Conclusion: Male, ex-smokers, and metastatic status (M1a) were the dominant risk factors for the incidence of EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma patients at Arifin Achmad Hospital.</p>
