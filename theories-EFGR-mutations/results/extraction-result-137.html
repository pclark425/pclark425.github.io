                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Mutation incidence and coincidence in non small-cell lung cancer: meta-analyses by ethnicity and histology (mutMap)</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background Meta-analyses were conducted to characterize patterns of mutation incidence in non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Design Nine genes with the most complete published mutation coincidence data were evaluated. One meta-analysis generated a ‘mutMap’ to visually represent mutation coincidence by ethnicity (Western/Asian) and histology (adenocarcinoma [ADC] or squamous cell carcinoma). Another meta-analysis evaluated incidence of individual mutations. Extended analyses explored incidence of EGFR and KRAS mutations by ethnicity, histology, and smoking status. Results Genes evaluated were TP53, EGFR, KRAS, LKB1, EML4-ALK, PTEN, BRAF, PIK3CA, and ErbB2. The mutMap highlighted mutation coincidences occurring in ≥5% of patients, including TP53 with KRAS or EGFR mutations in patients with ADC, and TP53 with LKB1 mutation in Western patients. TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene overall. Frequencies of TP53, EGFR, KRAS, LKB1, PTEN, and BRAF mutations were influenced by histology and/or ethnicity. Although EGFR mutations were most frequent in patients with ADC and never/light smokers from Asia, and KRAS mutations were most frequent in patients with ADC and ever/heavy smokers from Western countries, both were detected outside these subgroups. Conclusions Potential molecular pathology segments of NSCLC were identified. Further studies of mutations in NSCLC are warranted to facilitate more specific diagnoses and guide treatment.</p>

The paper also cites preliminary reports (e.g., Latin America intermediate frequencies) consistent with population-level variation. However, direct genetic or mechanistic data linking ancestry or specific environmental exposures to EGFR mutagenesis are not provided in the meta-analysis.</td>

The meta-analysis did not perform analyses that could definitively separate genetic ancestry from environmental or lifestyle confounders, so no mechanism is proven.</td>

The paper recommends screening beyond classic groups (ADC and never/light smokers) because EGFR mutations are present in non-ADC histologies and such tumors have shown TKI benefit in limited reports. The emergence of T790M as a common resistance mechanism is highlighted, informing monitoring and subsequent therapy selection.</td>
