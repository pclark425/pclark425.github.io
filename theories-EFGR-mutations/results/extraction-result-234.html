                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background: Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have considerably benefited from the molecular identification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations and subsequent targeted therapy against these biomarkers. Few studies have been undertaken in the Indian population on the analysis of both EGFR and ALK mutations in lung adenocarcinoma cases. Aim and Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of EGFR and ALK mutations in lung adenocarcinoma patients, as well as to link mutational status with age, sex, and smoking history. Materials and Methods: This single hospital-based retrospective study was conducted at the Department of Medical Oncology, Acharya Harihar Post Graduate Institute of Cancer, Cuttack, on histologically proven lung adenocarcinoma cases over a duration of two years from 01.08.2019 to 31.07.2021. Results: Out of a total of 164 cases, males comprised 89 (54.26%) of the 164 lung adenocarcinoma cases, while females comprised 75 (45.73%). EGFR mutations were found in 42 (26.75%) of the patients. In 9 cases, the ALK gene rearrangement was also determined to be positive (5.66%). In terms of EGFR and ALK mutations, there was no statistically significant relationship between patient age and gender. (P-value < 0.05). In our research, we found a link between nonsmokers and EGFR and ALK mutations. (P-value <0.05). The deletion of exon 19 (76.19%) was the most prevalent mutation, followed by the exon 21 L858R mutation (14.28%). Conclusion: This study was found to have a significantly higher rate of EGFR and ALK mutation in the Indian population with adenocarcinoma of lung compared to Western populations. To get the maximum benefit from targeted therapies, all patients of adenocarcinoma of the lung should have mutational testing for EGFR and ALK as part of a broad molecular pannel.</p>
