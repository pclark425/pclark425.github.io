                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Distinct EGFR Mutation Pattern in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Xuanwei Region of China: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background In the Xuanwei region of China, lung cancer incidence and mortality are among the highest in China, attributed to severe air pollution generated by combustion of smoky coal. No study has yet comprehensively evaluated the prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation characteristics in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Xuanwei. This meta-analysis was designed to analyze the EGFR mutation pattern in NSCLC patients in Xuanwei region of Yunnan Province in China. Methods Electronic databases were comprehensively searched and relevant literatures were retrieved. The odds ratio (OR) for EGFR mutations between Xuanwei region and non-Xuanwei region was calculated, and the absolute incidence of EGFR mutations in Xuanwei was pooled by mutation subtype. Results Seven studies involving 1,355 patients with NSCLC from Yunnan Province (442 in Xuanwei and 913 in other regions) were included. The EGFR mutation rate ranged between 30.19% and 55.56%. Higher uncommon EGFR mutations (OR: 5.69, 95%CI: 2.23–14.49, P<0.001) and lower common EGFR mutations (OR: 0.18, 95%CI: 0.07–0.45, P<0.001) were found in Xuanwei region, compared with non-Xuanwei region. Specifically, the uncommon EGFR mutation rate was 59.50% and common EGFR mutation rate was 40.50% in Xuanwei. The mutation incidence of exon 18 G719X (OR: 3.21, 95%CI: 1.48–6.97, P=0.003), exon 20 S768I (OR: 6.44; 95%CI: 2.66–15.60; P<0.001), and exon 18 G719X + 20 S768I (OR: 6.55; 95%CI: 1.92–22.33; P=0.003) in Xuanwei were significantly higher, while the frequency of 19 deletion (OR: 0.28, 95%CI: 0.11–0.77, P<0.001) and 21 L858R mutation (OR: 0.51, 95%CI: 0.31–0.84, P=0.007) were lower. Conclusions The results highlight the distinct EGFR mutation spectrum of NSCLC patients in Xuanwei region compared with other regions, with higher uncommon mutations but lower common mutations. The distinct Xuanwei featured genetic variations provide a unique model to further study carcinogenesis of lung cancer.</p>

                            <td>Limitations discussed include retrospective study designs, relatively small sample sizes, heterogeneity between studies, differences in EGFR detection methods (majority used ARMS PCR which detects known mutations; only one study used NGS), possible selection bias toward adenocarcinoma histology, and potential interplay between smoking and coal exposure (smoking rates and second-hand smoke are high in the region and may confound associations).</td>

                            <td>Xuanwei NSCLC patients (East Asian Chinese) show a markedly different EGFR mutation spectrum compared with other regions of Yunnan: much higher prevalence of uncommon EGFR mutations (especially exon 18 G719X, exon 20 S768I and their combinations) and lower prevalence of the classic sensitizing mutations (exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R). The authors propose that indoor coal burning (PAH exposure), local environmental exposures, and possibly distinct genetic susceptibility underlie these ethnic/regionally specific differences; this may have implications for targeted therapy response since uncommon mutations often confer different/smaller responses to EGFR-TKIs.</td>
