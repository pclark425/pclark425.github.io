                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> The prevalence of EGFR mutation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Objectives Estimate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation prevalence in all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and patient subgroups. Results A total of 456 studies were included, reporting 30,466 patients with EGFR mutation among 115,815 NSCLC patients. The overall pooled prevalence for EGFR mutations was 32.3% (95% CI 30.9% to 33.7%), ranging from 38.4% (95% CI: 36.5% to 40.3%) in China to 14.1% (95% CI: 12.7% to 15.5%) in Europe. The pooled prevalence of EGFR mutation was higher in females (females vs. males: 43.7% vs. 24.0%; OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.5 to 2.9), non-smokers (non-smokers vs. past or current smokers: 49.3% vs. 21.5%; OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 3.4 to 4.0), and patients with adenocarcinoma (adenocarcinoma vs. non-adenocarcinoma: 38.0% vs. 11.7%; OR: 4.1, 95% CI: 3.6 to 4.8). Materials and Methods PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to June 2013. Eligible studies reported EGFR mutation prevalence and the association with at least one of the following factors: gender, smoking status and histology. Random-effects models were used to pool EGFR mutation prevalence data. Conclusion This study provides the exact prevalence of EGFR mutations in different countries and NSCLC patient subgroups.</p>

                            <td>Across constituent studies listed in the supplement authors propose several explanations for higher EGFR mutation prevalence in East Asian cohorts: (1) differences in smoking exposure patterns (lower cumulative smoking in many East Asian adenocarcinoma cohorts) and a larger proportion of never-smokers; (2) environmental exposures such as passive smoking/long-term environmental tobacco smoke and radon exposure causing DNA damage (supported by studies cited: Kawaguchi 2011; Taga 2012; Kawahara 2010); (3) host genetic/germline polymorphisms (EGFR kinase-domain polymorphisms, estrogen-pathway gene polymorphisms) that may predispose to EGFR-mutant tumors (Sasaki 2008; Yang SY 2011); and (4) hormonal influences, particularly in women (ERβ expression associations). The supplement itself compiles and cites these hypothesis-generating primary studies but does not adjudicate causality.</td>

                            <td>The supplement lists studies with contrasting or null findings: e.g., Toyooka et al. (2008) report that EGFR mutation (but not sex and smoking) is independently associated with favorable prognosis in gefitinib-treated patients — indicating sex/smoking may not fully account for outcomes; US pooled non-smoker prevalence (46.5%) is similar to East Asian non-smoker prevalence in some tables, indicating that among never-smokers the East Asian vs non-East Asian difference may be reduced; the supplement highlights very high between-study heterogeneity and method-related prevalence differences which can produce inconsistent results across cohorts. The supplement does not present unified negative association effect-sizes but it explicitly documents heterogeneity and method/sampling variability as important limitations.</td>

                            <td>Limitations documented in the supplement: extremely high heterogeneity (I^2 often >80–90%), wide variation in detection methods and sensitivity (many different molecular assays), variable sample types (tissue vs blood), lack of patient-level pooled data (meta-analysis of published prevalences rather than IPD), use of study location as proxy for ancestry, potential publication and selection biases (many single-center, retrospective studies), and limited or no adjustment for confounders (sex, age, smoking) in the pooled country comparisons. No centralized funding/conflict-of-interest statement is shown in the excerpted supplement tables; constituent primary studies may have individual disclosures.</td>
