                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> New insights into the biology and development of lung cancer in never smokers—implications for early detection and treatment</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Despite never smokers comprising between 10 and 25% of all cases, lung cancer in never smokers (LCNS) is relatively under characterized from an etiological and biological perspective. The application of multi-omics techniques on large patient cohorts has significantly advanced the current understanding of LCNS tumor biology. By synthesizing the findings of multi-omics studies on LCNS from a clinical perspective, we can directly translate knowledge regarding tumor biology into implications for patient care. Primarily focused on never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma, this review details the predominance of driver mutations, particularly in East Asian patients, as well as the frequency and importance of germline variants in LCNS. The mutational patterns present in LCNS tumors are thoroughly explored, highlighting the high abundance of the APOBEC signature. Moreover, this review recognizes the spectrum of immune profiles present in LCNS tumors and posits how it can be translated to treatment selection. The recurring and novel insights from multi-omics studies on LCNS tumor biology have a wide range of clinical implications. Risk factors such as exposure to outdoor air pollution, second hand smoke, and potentially diet have a genomic imprint in LCNS at varying degrees, and although they do not encompass all LCNS cases, they can be leveraged to stratify risk. Germline variants similarly contribute to a notable proportion of LCNS, which warrants detailed documentation of family history of lung cancer among never smokers and demonstrates value in developing testing for pathogenic variants in never smokers for early detection in the future. Molecular driver subtypes and specific co-mutations and mutational signatures have prognostic value in LCNS and can guide treatment selection. LCNS tumors with no known driver alterations tend to be stem-like and genes contributing to this state may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Overall, the comprehensive findings of multi-omics studies exert a wide influence on clinical management and future research directions in the realm of LCNS.</p>

Mutational signatures and proteomic markers (APOBEC3, kinases) could inform immunotherapy responsiveness and novel targeted approaches.
