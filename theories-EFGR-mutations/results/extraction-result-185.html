                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Oncogenic Genetic Alterations in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in Southwestern China</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Purpose To investigate the impact of oncogenic genetic alterations (GAs) on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in southwestern China. Patients and Methods We first collected 579 pathologically confirmed NSCLC specimens and then used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate the DNA samples for GAs. Both the tissue and plasma samples were provided by 28 patients. Furthermore, subgroup analyses based on sample type, concordance, and GA type were carried out. Results GAs were detected by NGS in 61.8% (358/579) of patients. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients (39.6%) harbored EGFR mutations, 63 (10.9%) harbored KRAS mutations, 13 (2.2%) harbored BRAF mutations, 30 (5.18%) harbored ALK fusions, and 13 (2.2%) had ROS1 fusions. We found that females (p < 0.01), nonsmokers (p < 0.001), adenocarcinoma (p < 0.001), and tissue (p = 0.03) had a relatively high EGFR mutation rate. Notably, NSCLC patients from Xuanwei had a significantly different mutational pattern for EGFR in comparison with that of non-Xuanwei patients (higher G719X + S768I mutations and multiple gene alterations, but fewer exon 19 deletion mutations and single gene alterations). We found that adenocarcinoma (p = 0.02), family history of malignancy (p = 0.03), Xuanwei origin (p < 0.001), and tissue (p = 0.04) were associated with a higher number of KRAS mutations. Subgroup analysis showed that ALK (p < 0.001) and ROS1 (p < 0.05) fusions and rare EGFR mutations (p < 0.001) were associated with non-Han ethnic patients. Conclusion Yunnan NSCLC patients from Xuanwei and non-Han ethnic patients had an obviously unique prevalence of GAs.</p>

(b) Prior environmental/biomarker literature cited: PAH-DNA adducts measured in Xuanwei residents and prior studies linking smoky coal/PAH exposure to lung cancer risk and to specific mutation patterns (cited Mumford et al., DeMarini et al.). (c) Biological plausibility: PAH exposure causes DNA adducts and has been linked to KRAS/EGFR mutations in referenced studies. (d) Geographic correlation: many non-Han patients live at >2000 m altitude (hypoxia/UV hypothesis) and statistical enrichment of rare alterations in those patients.</td>

(3) Single-center recruitment and limited sample sizes for some subgroups (e.g., Xuanwei and non-Han) raise the possibility of sampling bias. (4) No direct genetic ancestry or germline analyses were performed to demonstrate an inherited basis; thus genetic inheritance remains speculative.

                            <td>Clinical implications noted: (a) High EGFR prevalence in this East Asian cohort supports routine EGFR testing and use of EGFR-TKIs when activating mutations are present. (b) Mutation-type heterogeneity (e.g., enrichment of rare mutations like S768I and combination mutations including T790M) may affect TKI responsiveness—S768I has uncertain sensitivity with mixed reports—and multiple mutations including T790M are implicated in resistance, guiding choices toward anti-T790M strategies or combination approaches. (c) Tissue testing shows higher EGFR detection rate than plasma (tissue 44.7% vs plasma overall lower), supporting tissue as preferred sample when available; plasma ctDNA NGS is useful as a supplement (reported sensitivity 91.3%, specificity 80.0% in 28 paired samples). (d) Non-Han enrichment for rare/other driver alterations suggests comprehensive NGS panels are particularly important in these subpopulations.</td>
