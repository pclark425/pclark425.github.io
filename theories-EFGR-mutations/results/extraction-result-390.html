                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in non-small cell lung cancer : current role and the future perspective</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Managing advanced non-small cell lung cancer has become far more complex than in the past. This in part is due to the fact that advances in molecular oncology allow for far more refined and effective treatment options for many lung cancer patients. One of the first advances was the identification of various biomarkers that are increasingly being tested for, even as a broad panel, that include some targets that we have been hearing about for a few years and others that are still emerging. Some of the most common biomarkers include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as well as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Also, despite the fact that we have known about Kirsten rat sarcoma for decades, therapies targeting this molecule has been more elusive. In addition, other potentially useful therapeutic targets are constantly emerging and incorporated in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Several of these have phase 2 (or beyond) data that have been compelling enough to lead to them being considered beyond EGFR, ALK, and c-ros oncogene 1. Emerging clinical trial data for patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations and ALK rearrangements, showed that tyrosine kinase inhibitors offer superior progression free survival and response rates over standard chemotherapy.</p>
