                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, with the highest mortality rate of all types of cancer. In the present study, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations of 354 primary patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of Chinese ethnicity were detected following formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimen DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification, and sanger sequencing. The total rate of occurrence of EGFR somatic mutation in these 354 patients was 48.02%. Of these detected EGFR mutations, 27.40% were located in exon 19 and 25.99% in exon 21. The most frequent mutation in exon 19 was E746-A750del (8.47%), and in exon 21, L858R (10.17%). EGFR mutation rates were significantly associated with sex [female vs. male: 60.13 vs. 38.81%; adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07–3.51, P=0.029], age (<60 vs. ≥60; 58.62 vs. 40.67%; adjusted OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.20–2.92; P=0.006) and histology [adenocarcinoma (ADC) vs. non-ADC; 52.76 vs. 26.56%; adjusted OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.28–4.50; P=0.007]. The frequency of E746_A750del, Q787Q and L858R mutations were significantly different in ADC patients compared with squamous cell carcinoma patients (P<0.001). Furthermore, a novel EGFR mutation, M793K, was detected in 7 NSCLC patients with possible gefitinib resistance. The present study analyzed the EGFR exon 18–21 mutation occurrence profile for Chinese patients with NSCLC and identified significant associations between different EGFR mutations with demographic and histological factors. These results may offer clinical benefits and potential novel treatments.</p>
