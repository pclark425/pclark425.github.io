                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The number of lung cancer cases estimates globally 2 million according to WHO, which represents approximately 11.6% of all cancers. The problem of lung diseases among women and women’s lung cancer is relatively not often discussed in the literature. There is evidence that there is a different distribution of histological types between sexes. The prevalence of adenocarcinoma (ADC) among women is observed for many years with an increasing tendency. This review focuses on the lung cancer risk factors such as tobacco smoking, second-hand smoke exposure, genetic and environmental factors, comorbidities and infectious agents. The declining tendency in smoking points to the necessity of focusing on other risk factors. Analysis of them within the context of morbidity and mortality can help to develop more effective screening programs.</p>

These differences support the need for routine molecular testing and may influence screening and treatment prioritization in different populations.</td>
