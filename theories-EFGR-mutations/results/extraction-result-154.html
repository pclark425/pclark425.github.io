                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Somatic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway in lung cancers</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in lung cancers have generated enormous interest, because they predict for sensitivity to TK inhibitors (TKIs). While mutational status is of great importance in determining response to TKIs, it is not the sole factor, and evidence is accumulating that EGFR gene amplification, other members of the EGFR family (HER2, HER3) and genes downstream of EGFR signaling (KRAS, BRAF), may be involved in cancer pathogenesis and the response of TKIs. EGFR mutations occur in highly selected subpopulations of lung cancer patients: adenocarcinoma histology, never‐smoker status, East Asian ethnicity and female gender. The recent finding of “a resistance associated” mutation for TKIs also provides new insights into this complicated mechanism. Thus, molecular‐based studies to analyze the biological functions and to assess TKI sensitivity depending on the type of mutations are required. Epidemiological studies to identify possible carcinogenic factor(s) affecting different subpopulations are also of interest. In addition, for optimal therapeutic approach a comprehensive understanding of the genes related to EGFR signaling pathway, including RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K‐AKT pathways, are required. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</p>

Identification of EGFR intron 1 CA-repeat and promoter SNPs with interethnic distribution that affect EGFR expression (cited studies). Observation that Asian patients resident in non-Asian countries (small N = 5 in this report) had high mutation rates (4/5), suggesting inherited/genetic contribution rather than purely geographic exposures. Mutual exclusivity with KRAS mutations (which are associated with smokers) supports different pathogenic pathways between smokers and never-smokers.</td>

The cross-geography Asian sample is very small (n = 5), limiting inference that genetics > environment. Authors note potential confounding because adenocarcinoma histology is more frequent in East Asian countries, so independent contributions of histology, ethnicity, smoking, and gender require multivariate analysis (not yet done in this review). No epidemiologic evidence in this paper proving specific environmental/lifestyle carcinogens that explain ethnic differences; tobacco exposure appears inversely correlated, arguing against smoking as the cause but not identifying an alternative exposure.</td>

However, mutations are not the sole determinant of response: EGFR gene amplification, allele imbalance, other ERBB family members (e.g., HER2/HER3) and downstream mutations (KRAS, BRAF) influence response and resistance (e.g., T790M confers acquired resistance). HER2 somatic mutations are reported with similar epidemiologic associations (East Asian, female, never-smoker), implying further stratification is clinically relevant.</td>
