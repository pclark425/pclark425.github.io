                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, with sharply increasing morbidity and mortality in the last decades. It was estimated that about 1.8 million new lung cancer cases occurred in 2012 worldwide by GLOBOCAN, occupied 13% of all cancers, with only 15% five-year survival rate. It has become the leading cause of cancer death among males in the whole world, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries (Torre et al., 2015). Even worse, the morbidity and mortality were both higher in China (National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, 2010; She et al., 2013). According to WHO classification of lung cancer, nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main type of lung cancer, occupied 80-85%, including Adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma, et al. NSCLC is a cancer with high malignancy, 30-40% cases are diagnosed at the advanced stage, without the opportunity of operation, and the effect of chemotherapy</p>
