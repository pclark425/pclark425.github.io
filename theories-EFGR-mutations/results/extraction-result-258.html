                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Evaluating Real World Mutational Differences Between Hispanics and Asians in NSCLC at a Large Academic Institution in Los Angeles</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We sought to compare the variances in mutational profiles between Hispanics and Asians in Los Angeles comparing 393 patients who received comprehensive genomic profiling. We saw a greater percentage of Hispanics with Kirsten rat sarcoma virus mutations despite similar smoking percentages and a greater percentage of Asians with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutations. These findings highlight the idea that ethnic and racial backgrounds can influence the effects of potentially carcinogenic exposures leading to variances of mutation frequency of non-small cell lung cancer among different ethnicities. Introduction: Hispanics living in the United States have higher rates of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations compared with Non-Hispanic Whites. While this higher incidence is like Asian patients living in the United States, the outcomes for Hispanic patients differ. We looked to compare the variances in mutational profiles between Hispanics and Asians in Los Angeles. Patients and Methods: Three hundred ninety three non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated at Los Angeles County + University of Southern California (LAC + USC) Medical Center and Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center who received comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) were evaluated from July 2017 to August 2020. CGP was done using tissue biopsies (n = 211) from Caris Life Sciences and liquid biopsies (n = 231) from Guardant Health. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated the role of race between Hispanics and Asians. Results: In the Hispanic cohort (n = 90), 50.0% were male, median age of diagnosis was 62, 54.5% were non-smokers, and 85.5% had adenocarcinoma. In Asians (n = 142), 47.5% were male, median age of diagnosis was 65, 59.6% were non-smokers, and 83.8% had adenocarcinoma. Hispanic patients had greater prevalence of Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutations (odds ratio [OR] 4.42, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.63–12.83) and lesser prevalence of EGFR mutations (OR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.16–0.59). There were a greater proportion of Hispanic smokers with KRAS mutations (14/41; 34.1%) than Asian smokers (4/58; 6.9%). Conclusion: We saw a greater percentage of Hispanics with KRAS mutations despite similar smoking percentages along with a greater percentage of Asians with EGFR mutations. This study shows that ethnic and racial backgrounds of the patient can influence the effects of potentially carcinogenic exposures leading to variances of mutation frequency of NSCLC among different ethnicities.</p>
