                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Variability in Survival Outcomes Among Asian Ethnic Groups with Stage IV NSCLC</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background and Objectives: Patients of Asian descent are often grouped together despite their diverse ethnicities and genetic backgrounds. Cancer outcomes result from a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and socioeconomic factors. This study aims to describe lung cancer survival outcome variations in Asian ethnic subgroups, hypothesizing that significant outcome differences exist between subgroups. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of the 2020 National Cancer Database identified patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Asian patients were subcategorized into nine groups: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Asian Indian/Pakistani, Vietnamese, Pacific Islander, Filipino, Laotian/Hmong/Kampuchean/Thai, and Other Asian/Asian not otherwise specified (NOS). The primary outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcome was utilization of palliative care. Kaplan–Meier analysis and multivariate Cox and logistic modeling were used to assess outcomes of interest. Results: A total of 23,747 Asian patients with stage IV NSCLC were identified. Demographic characteristics of the subgroups varied by age, sex, Charlson–Deyo Comorbidity Index, and utilization of palliative care. Relative to Chinese Asians, multivariate Cox analysis showed worse survival outcomes among patients categorized as Japanese, Korean, Pacific Islanders, Filipino, and Laotian/Hmong/Kampuchean/Thai. The rate of palliative care utilization also varied among Asian subgroups. Compared to Chinese patients, palliative care was more likely to be utilized by patients categorized as Japanese and Pacific Islander. Conclusions: Amongst Asian subgroups, variations in survival outcomes and palliative care utilization in stage IV NSCLC patients were observed. Surgeons should acknowledge these disparities and consider disaggregating Asian races in prognosis analysis to enhance understanding of race’s impact on outcomes. Recognizing these differences is crucial for guiding personalized treatment strategies, optimizing resource allocation, and informing health policy to ensure equitable cancer care for all Asian populations.</p>
