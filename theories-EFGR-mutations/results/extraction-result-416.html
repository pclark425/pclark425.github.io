                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Abstract Background Osimertinib is a 3rd-generation, irreversible, oral EGFR-TKI that potently and selectively inhibits both EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) and EGFR T790M resistance mutations, and has demonstrated efficacy in NSCLC CNS metastases. In the phase III FLAURA study (NCT02296125), osimertinib resulted in significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit (primary endpoint; datacut off [DCO] 12 June 2017) over comparator EGFR-TKI (HR 0.46, p  Methods Eligible patients (pts): ≥18 years (Japan: ≥20), treatment-naive with Ex19del/L858R EGFRm advanced NSCLC; WHO performance status 0–1. Pts with stable CNS metastases not requiring steroids for ≥2 weeks were allowed. Pts were randomised 1:1 to osimertinib 80 mg once daily (qd) orally (po) or comparator EGFR-TKI (gefitinib 250 mg qd/erlotinib 150 mg qd po), stratified by mutation status (Ex19del/L858R) and race (Asian/non-Asian). Crossover was allowed for pts in the comparator EGFR-TKI arm upon central confirmation of progression and T790M positivity. Primary endpoint: PFS by RECIST v1.1, per investigator. OS was a secondary endpoint. DCO 25 June 2019. Results Globally, 556 pts were randomised to osimertinib (n = 279) or comparator EGFR-TKI (n = 277). Per study protocol, 70 (25%) pts crossed over from comparator EGFR-TKI to osimertinib. Osimertinib significantly improved OS vs comparator EGFR-TKI. All causality AEs, per investigator: osimertinib, 98% (grade ≥3, 42%); comparator EGFR-TKI, 98% (grade ≥3, 47%). AEs leading to discontinuation: osimertinib, 15%; comparator EGFR-TKI, 18%. The safety profile appears consistent with previously reported data. Table . LBA5_PR Efficacy output Osimertinib n = 279 Comparator EGFR-TKI n = 277 OS hazard ratio 0.799 (0.641, 0.997); p = 0.0462 (95.05% confidence interval) Median OS, months 38.6 31.8 (95% confidence interval) (34.5, 41.8) (26.6, 36.0) Deaths, total pts (%) 155 (56) 166 (60) Median follow-up for OS in all pts, months 35.8 27.0 Median follow-up for OS in censored* pts, months 43.1 43.1 12-month survival rate, % 89 83 (95% confidence interval) (85, 92) (77, 87) 24-month survival rate, % 74 59 (95% confidence interval) (69, 79) (53, 65) 36-month survival rate, % 54 44 (95% confidence interval) (48, 60) (38, 50) OS for patients in the full analysis set was analysed using a log rank test (stratified by race and mutation type) for generation of the p-value and using the Breslow approach for handling ties. The median OS with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by Kaplan Meier technique. For statistical significance, a 2-sided p-value of less than 0.0495, as determined by the O’Brien-Fleming approach was required due the previous interim analysis.*Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Conclusions Osimertinib provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS vs comparator EGFR-TKI in first-line pts with EGFRm advanced NSCLC.
