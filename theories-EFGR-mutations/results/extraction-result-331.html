                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Molecular analysis of genetic mutations in non-small cell lung cancer in Morocco</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a significant global health issue with diverse molecular profiles affecting treatment responses. Yet, NSCLC's molecular epidemiology in Morocco is largely unexplored. This study focuses on NSCLC genetic mutations, specifically in adenocarcinoma, among Moroccan patients to contribute to understanding NSCLC in this population. Ninety-four patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were processed, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted using standardized protocols. Mutations were detected using the AmoyDx Pan Lung Cancer Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Panel kit, and their frequencies were assessed through statistical analysis. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations were detected in 22.34% of patients, predominantly exon 19 deletions (66.66%) and exon 21 L858R mutations (23.80%). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusion was observed in 3.19% of patients, and KRAS mutations in 1.06%. No mutations were found in other tested genes. A slightly higher mutation rate was noted in females (54.16%) compared to males (45.84%). The study reveals a distinct mutation profile in Moroccan NSCLC patients, with a notable prevalence of EGFR mutations, albeit lower than in some Asian populations. The significance of EGFR mutations in treatment response aligns with global findings, highlighting the importance of understanding regional molecular variations for personalized therapy. Despite limitations in sample size and clinical data, this study sheds light on the genetic landscape of NSCLC in Morocco. The observed mutation rates, particularly in EGFR, underscore the potential for targeted therapies in Moroccan NSCLC patients, emphasizing the need for further research to refine treatment strategies tailored to this population.</p>
