                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> EGFR Mutations in Latinos From the United States and Latin America</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Purpose Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are limited and conflicting reports on the frequency of EGFR mutations in Latinos. Patients and Methods Samples from 642 patients with NSCLC from seven institutions in the United States and Latin America were assessed for EGFR mutations (exons 18 to 21) at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified central laboratories. Results EGFR mutation analysis was successfully performed in 480 (75%) of 642 patients; 90 (19%) were Latinos, 318 (66%) were non-Latino whites, 35 (7%) were non-Latino Asians, 30 (6%) were non-Latino blacks, and seven (2%) were of other races or ethnicities. EGFR mutations were found in 21 (23%) of 90 Latinos with varying frequencies according to the country of origin; Latinos from Peru (37%), followed by the United States (23%), Mexico (18%), Venezuela (10%), and Bolivia (8%). In never-smoker Latinos and Latinos with adenocarcinoma histology, EGFR mutation frequencies were 38% and 30%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the frequency of EGFR mutations among the different racial and ethnic subgroups analyzed (P < .001), with non-Latino Asians having the highest frequency (57%) followed by Latinos (23%), non-Latino whites (19%), and non-Latino blacks (10%). There was no difference between Latinos (23%) and non-Latinos (22%; P = .78) and Latinos and non-Latino whites (P = .37). Patients from Peru had an overall higher frequency of mutations (37%) than all other Latinos (17%), but this difference only exhibited a trend toward significance (P = .058). Conclusion There was no significant difference between the frequency of EGFR mutations in NSCLC in Latinos and non-Latinos.</p>
