                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important gene in the development of lung adenocarcinoma. However, there is controversy regarding the association between EGFR mutations and survival time of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. In the present study, tissue specimens and clinical data were collected from 219 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who had not undergone prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. EGFR mutations were detected using a fluorescence polymerase chain reaction method, and the association between EGFR mutations and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. Overall survival (OS) curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the influence of clinicopathological characteristics on OS was analyzed using the Cox regression model. The EGFR mutation rate was 50.7%, and the most common mutations were the L858R substitution mutation in exon 21 (L858R; 54.9%) and the deletion mutation in exon 19 (19-Del; 36%). The presence of EGFR mutations varied significantly with sex, smoking history, T stage, vascular invasion and adenocarcinoma subtypes (P<0.05). The survival time was significantly longer for female, young (<60 years-old), non-smokers or patients exhibiting EGFR mutations (G719X, 19-Del, L858R and L861Q). The survival time was also significantly longer for patients with a 19-Del mutation, early stage tumors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted therapy-treated patients, for those not exhibiting nerve or vascular invasion, and for those without disease recurrence (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor pathological Tumor-Node-Metastasis (pTNM) stage, nerve invasion, vascular invasion, EGFR mutation and the 19-Del mutation were independent predictors (P<0.05). Therefore, tumor pTNM stage, nerve invasion, vascular invasion and EGFR mutation status, particularly that of 19-Del, were independent prognostic factors for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.</p>
