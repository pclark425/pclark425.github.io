                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutations and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase/Oncogene or C-Ros Oncogene 1 (ALK/ROS1) Fusions Inflict Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Female Patients Older Than 60 Years of Age</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background Lung cancer has become a leading disease for the tumor-induced mortality. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancers. The present research aimed to evaluate the correlation between the anaplastic lymphoma kinase/oncogene or c-ros oncogene 1 (ALK/ROS1) fusions or mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ages or gender of patients. Material/Methods Among 1449 NSCLC patients, 457 patients who were diagnosed as consecutive EGFR mutations or ALK/ROS1 fusions between November 2016 and February 2018 were involved in the present study. EGFR genes or ALK/ROS1 mutations were detected by using DNA sequencing technique and amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS). The mRNAs of ROS1 and ALK fusion were examined by using polymerase chain reaction technique and fusion gene detection kit. Results Females were more often inflicted by the EGFR mutations, especially for the exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation. There were significantly more ALK/ROS1 fusions in females compared to males (P<0.05) and significantly more ALK/ROS1 fusions in <60 years of age patients compared to patients older than 60 years of age (P<0.05). Exon 21 L858R and L861Q dominantly occurred in patients ≥60 years of age and exon 19 deletion in patients <60 years of age. EML-ALK-1 mainly existed in the female NSCLC patients. Conclusions EGFR mutations and ALK/ROS1 fusions mainly occurred in the NSCLC female patients who were older than 60 years of age.</p>
