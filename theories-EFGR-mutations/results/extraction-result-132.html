                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Emerging ethnic differences in lung cancer therapy</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Although global clinical trials for lung cancer can enable the development of new agents efficiently, whether the results of clinical trials performed in one population can be fully extrapolated to another population remains questionable. A comparison of phase III trials for the same drug combinations against lung cancer in different countries shows a great diversity in haematological toxicity. One possible reason for this diversity may be that different ethnic populations may have different physiological capacities for white blood cell production and maturation. In addition, polymorphisms in the promoter and coding regions of drug-metabolising enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4 and UGT1A1) or in transporters (e.g., ABCB1) may vary among different ethnic populations. For example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are more effective in Asian patients than in patients of other ethnicities, a characteristic that parallels the incidence of EGFR-activating mutations. Interstitial lung disease associated with the administration of gefitinib is also more common among Japanese patients than among patients of other ethnicities. Although research into these differences has just begun, these studies suggest that possible pharmacogenomic and tumour genetic differences associated with individual responses to anticancer agents should be carefully considered when conducting global clinical trials.</p>

                            <td>1) CA-SSR1 (intron 1 CA repeat) studies: Buerger et al. (2000, 2004) showed shorter CA-SSR1 lengths are associated with higher EGFR expression in breast cancer and repeat-length distribution varies by ethnicity (Liu et al. 2003). 2) Promoter SNPs (-219G/T and -191C/A) were shown to affect promoter activity and EGFR expression (Liu et al. 2005), and Nomura et al. (2007) reported polymorphic types associated with low EGFR expression are more common in Asians. 3) Epidemiologic association: populations (females, never-smokers, adenocarcinoma) that have higher EGFR mutation rates also correspond to groups with higher TKI response; the aggregated prevalence data in Table 3 (Asian vs Western differences) supports a real ethnic disparity in mutation frequency. 4) Association studies cited (Kosaka, Pao, Shigematsu, Marchetti, Qin, Soung, Tokumo, Sasaki, Yang) provide pooled observational evidence of higher mutation rates in Asians.</td>

The paper does not present negative genetic studies disproving the hypothesis, and notes that the relationship is speculative: e.g., Asians tend to have longer CA-SSR1 repeats (Liu et al. 2003) which in other contexts correlated with lower EGFR expression, but direct linkage from that to increased somatic activating mutations has not been proven. Overall, there is a lack of direct mechanistic/functional evidence within these cited studies showing that inherited EGFR regulatory variants drive the higher somatic mutation prevalence.</td>

                            <td>1) Higher prevalence of EGFR-activating mutations in Asians parallels higher objective response rates to EGFR TKIs: gefitinib response 28% in Japanese patients vs 9-12% in other ethnicities (IDEAL trials); subgroup ISEL analysis showed improved median survival in Asian patients receiving gefitinib (9.5 vs 5.5 months; HR 0.66). 2) Erlotinib trials: higher response rates and longer median survival reported in Japanese trials (responses 28% and MST 13.8 months in combined Japanese phase II trials) compared with lower response rates in US/Western trials (e.g., 12% response). 3) These differences suggest ethnic/biological stratification (testing for EGFR mutations) is clinically important for predicting benefit from EGFR TKIs and for designing global clinical trials.</td>
