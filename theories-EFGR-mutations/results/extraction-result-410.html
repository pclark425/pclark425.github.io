                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Association of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene polymorphism with lung cancer risk: a systematic review.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Abstract Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor family, which is thought to be involved in the development of cancer, as the EGFR gene is often amplified, and/or mutated in cancer cells. Lung cancer remains one of the most major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer cause. Gene polymorphism factor has been reported to be an important factor which increases the susceptibility of lung cancer. There lacks a well-documented diagnostic approach for the lung cancer risk, and the etiology of lung cancer is not clear. The current systematic review was performed to explore the association of EGFR gene polymorphism with lung cancer risk. In this review, association of EGFR 181946C > T, 8227G > A gene polymorphism with lung cancer was found, and EGFR Short genotype of cytosine adenine repeat number polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.</p>
