                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Frequency of Driver Mutations in Lung Adenocarcinoma from Female Never-Smokers Varies with Histologic Subtypes and Age at Diagnosis</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Purpose: Our previous study revealed that 90% [47 of 52; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.79–0.96] of Chinese never-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma harbor known oncogenic driver mutations in just four genes EGFR , ALK , HER2 , and KRAS . Here, we examined the status of known driver mutations speciﬁcally in female never-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma. Experimental Design: Tumors were genotyped for mutations in EGFR , KRAS , ALK , HER2 , and BRAF . Data on age,stage, tumor differentiation, histologic subtypes, and molecular alterations wererecorded from 349resectedlungadenocarcinomasfromfemalenever-smokers.Wefurthercomparedtheclinicopathologic parameters according to mutational status of these genes. Results: Two hundred and sixty-six (76.2%) tumors harbored EGFR mutations, 16 (4.6%) HER2 mutations, 15 (4.3%) EML4-ALK fusions, seven (2.0%) KRAS mutations, and two (0.6%) BRAF mutations. In univariate analysis, patients harboring EGFR mutations were signiﬁcantly older ( P < 0.001), whereas patients harboring HER2 mutations were signiﬁcantly younger ( P ¼ 0.036). Higher prevalence of KRAS ( P ¼ 0.028) and HER2 ( P ¼ 0.021) mutations was found in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA). The frequency of EGFR mutations was positively correlated with acinar predominant tumors ( P ¼ 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that older age at diagnosis ( P ¼ 0.013) and acinar predominant subtype ( P ¼ 0.005) were independent predictors of EGFR mutations. Independent predictors of HER2 mutations included younger age ( P ¼ 0.030) and IMA ( P ¼ 0.017). IMA ( P ¼ 0.006) and poor differentiation ( P ¼ 0.028) were independently associated with KRAS mutations. Conclusions: The frequency of driver mutations in never-smoking female lung adenocarcinoma varies with histologic subtypes and age at diagnosis. These data have implications for both clinical trial design and therapeutic strategies. Clin Cancer Res; 18(7); 1–7. (cid:2) 2012 AACR.</p>
