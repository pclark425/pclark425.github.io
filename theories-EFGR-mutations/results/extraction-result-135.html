                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> The Genomic Landscape of Romanian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: The Insights from Routine NGS Testing with the OncomineTM Dx Express Test at the PATHOS Molecular Pathology Laboratory</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Simple Summary This study looked at the genetic makeup of lung cancer in Romanian patients to help guide more personalized treatments. Researchers analyzed 398 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using advanced technology that detects mutations in cancer-related genes. Most patients were older men, and the most common tumor type was adenocarcinoma. The most frequent mutation found was in the KRAS gene (especially the p.G12C variant), followed by changes in EGFR and BRAF genes. Less common but important alterations were found in RET, ALK, ERBB2, and FGFR genes. These genetic changes can be targeted with specific treatments, which means patients could benefit from drugs designed for their unique cancer profile. This is the first large-scale study of its kind in Romania and shows that local data is essential for guiding cancer therapy, as some gene changes were more common in Romanian patients compared to other populations.</p>
