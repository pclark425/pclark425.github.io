                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> The Epidermal Growth Factor, Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase, and ROS Proto-oncogene 1 Mutation Profile of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinomas in the Turkish Population: A Single-Center Analysis</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Objective: The management of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) has changed with the identification of molecular pathways. We aimed to reveal the 3-year epidermal growth factor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) mutation profile in the Turkish population. Material and Methods: The histopathological and molecular data of all NSCLC cases from our department between May 2019 and April 2022 were evaluated. Results: Molecular testing was performed in 197 NSCLC cases, and results were obtained in 182 (92.4%) (M/F: 144/38, aged 39-86). Of these, 121 were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, 36 with squamous cell carcinoma, and 25 with NSCLC-not otherwise specified. The EGFR mutation was seen in 21 (11.5%) cases (6 exon 19 deletions, 3 exon 18 [all codon 719], 2 exon 20, 8 exon 21 point mutations, 1 concurrent exon 19 deletion and exon 20 codon 790 M point mutation, and 1 concurrent exon 19 deletion and exon 21 point mutation). The double mutation rate of EGFR was 1.1%. The mean age of these patients was 63.4 (40-79), with 24% of all females (n = 9) and 8.3% of all males (n = 12). The ALK mutation was detected in 6 (3.3%) patients (M/F: 4/2, aged 45-82), whereas the ROS1 mutation was detected in 3 (1.7%) (M/F: 2/1, aged 40-64). Conclusion: It is well established in the literature that EGFR-activating mutation rates vary depending on regions and ethnic groups. We concluded that the EGFR-activating mutation rates of the Turkish population are similar to the European molecular data instead of the Asian. The ALK and ROS1 mutation rates also seem concordant with the literature.</p>
