                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Clinical and Biological Features Associated With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Gene Mutations in Lung Cancers</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background: Mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in lung cancers are associated with increased sensitivity of these cancers to drugs that inhibit EGFR kinase activity. However, the role of such mutations in the pathogenesis of lung cancers is unclear. Methods: We sequenced exons 18 – 21 of the EGFR TK domain from genomic DNA isolated from 617 non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and 524 normal lung tissue samples from the same patients and 36 neuroendocrine lung tumors collected from patients in Japan, Taiwan, the United States, and Australia and from 243 other epithelial cancers. Mutation status was compared with clinicopathologic features and with the presence of mutations in KRAS, a gene in the EGFR signaling pathway that is also frequently mutated in lung cancers. All statistical tests were two sided. Results: We detected a total of 134 EGFR TK domain mutations in 130 (21%) of the 617 NSCLCs but not in any of the other carcinomas, nor in nonmalignant lung tissue from the same patients. In NSCLC patients, EGFR TK domain mutations were statistically signi ﬁ cantly more frequent in never smokers than ever smokers (51% versus 10%), in adenocarcinomas versus cancer of other histologies (40% versus 3%), in patients of East Asian ethnicity versus other ethnicities (30% versus 8%), and in females versus males (42% versus</p>

These conformational/activation changes increase kinase activity and sensitivity to EGFR TK inhibitors. Additionally, ~40% of sequenced electropherograms suggested allelic imbalance/amplification of the mutant allele, implicating increased copy number of the mutant EGFR as a contributing factor.</td>

BAC (bronchioloalveolar carcinoma) strict WHO-defined subtype was not associated with EGFR mutation status in reviewed US adenocarcinomas; sample selection differences and limited tumor sampling (edge vs center) could confound histologic associations.
