                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Clinical application of liquid biopsy genomic profiling in NSCLC: Asian perspectives</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Molecular profiling is essential for treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Extensive evidence supports the clinical application of liquid biopsy in molecular profiling and thus has been incorporated into multiple international guidelines. In Asia, clinical practice of liquid biopsy varies between countries owing to difference in molecular characteristics of lung cancer as well as variations in socioeconomic conditions and healthcare systems. The current review covers the landscape and clinical application of liquid biopsy in Asia. An emphasis is placed on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation given its high prevalence in the region. We focus on the emerging data on liquid biopsy in reference to risk stratification, recurrence monitoring, and lung cancer screening in Asian context. Finally, we present potential solutions to optimize the clinical application of liquid biopsy in Asian countries.</p>

The geographic/ethnic concentration of pulmonary LELC and its linkage to latent EBV infection is presented as evidence that infection/environment can drive ethnic differences in histologic/molecular patterns.</td>
